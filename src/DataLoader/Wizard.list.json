			"body": "This spell enables the wizard to cause nonmagical fires--from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as the area of effect--to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light to become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to double the normal radius. Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elementals or similar creatures."

			"saving": "None",
			"body": "When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat--anything larger than about 1/2 cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.<br />The material components of this spell are a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire."

			"body": "By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does not absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.<br />The material component is a piece of finely cured leather that has been blessed by a priest."

			"name": "Audible Glamer",
			"book": "Base",
			"schools": "Illusion, Song",
			"rng": "60 yds. + 10 yds./level",
			"compo": "V, S, M",
			"dur": "3 rds./level",
			"castime": "1",
			"aoe": "Hearing range",
			"saving": "Special",
			"body": "When the audible glamer spell is cast, the wizard causes a volume of sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an audible glamer spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.<br />A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound, emanating from the caster's direction. Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the phantasmal force spell.<br />The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax."

His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: The wizard's thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets 5 feet long in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. Flammable materials touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth, paper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken."

			"compo": "V, S",
			"dur": "1 hr./level",
			"castime": "1",
			"aoe": "Special",
			"saving": "None",
			"body": "Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentration of spellcasters, and can only create small, obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.<br />Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard."

The item will head off in that direction until it reaches the limit of the spell and then fall to the ground. The item must be loose or freestanding or not held by someone, and light enough to move (otherwise the item will quiver in place and the spell will be wasted).<br />This spell can be used offensively to hurl an item into an enemy. The item hits the individual in its path with the caster's THAC0 with a +3 to the die. It is considered a +3 magical weapon when rolling to hit but not when rolling damage. The damage caused depends on the item, but use the following guidelines:<br />• Weapon: As weapon +1<br />• Small item: 2-3 points<br />• Large item (2-3 lbs.): 2-4 points"

The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way."

			"body": "This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.<br />The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster's group in the same round the charm is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw.<br />If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for \"just a minute or two.\" Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands).<br />The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according to the creature's Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.<br />If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.<br />Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.<br /><table><tr><th>Intelligence Score</th><th>Time Between Checks</th></tr><tr><td>3 or less</td><td>3 months</td></tr><tr><td>4-6</td><td>2 months</td></tr><tr><td>7-9</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>10-12</td><td>3 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>15-16</td><td>1 week</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>3 days</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>2 days</td></tr><tr><td>19 or more</td><td>1 day</td></tr></table><br />Note: The period between checks is the time period during which the check occurs.

Creatures not rated for Strength suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for every other successful touch. Lost Strength returns at the rate of 1 point per hour. Damage must be cured magically or healed naturally.<br />This spell has a special effect on undead creatures.

			"body": "This spell causes a 4-inch-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. Within the limits described below, the sphere can appear in a variety of colors; each color indicates a different special power. The caster can hurl the sphere at an opponent up to 30 yards away, providing there are no barriers between the caster and the target. If the target is no more than 10 yards away, the caster's to hit roll is made with a +3 bonus. If the target is 10-20 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +2 bonus. If the target is 20-30 yards away, the caster's roll is made with a +1 bonus.<br />If the chromatic orb misses its target, it dissipates without effect. If the target creature makes a successful saving throw, the chromatic orb is also ineffective. Otherwise, the color of the orb determines the amount of damage inflicted and its special power, as summarized on Table 16; details about the special powers are listed below. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower; for instance, a 3rd-level wizard can create an orange, red, or white orb. The material component for this spell is a gem of the appropriate hue or any diamond. The gem must have a value of at least 50 gp.<br />Light from the orb causes the victim to become surrounded by light to a radius of 20 feet, as if affected by a light spell. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time the victim makes his attack rolls and saving throws at a -4 penalty, and his AC is penalized by 4.<br />Heat from the orb is intense enough to melt 1 cubic yard of ice. The victim suffers a loss of 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Dexterity (or for victims without these attributes, -1 to hit and a penalty of 1 to AC) for 1 round.<br />Fire from the orb ignites all combustible materials within 3 feet of the victim.<br />Blindness from the orb causes the victim to become blind as per the spell. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster.<br />Stinking cloud from the orb surrounds the victim in a 5-foot-radius noxious cloud. The victim must save vs. poison or will be reeling and unable to attack until he leaves the area of the vapors. Magnetism from the orb has an effect only if the victim is wearing armor made from iron. The iron armor becomes magically magnetized for 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Other iron objects within 3 feet of the caster will stick tight to the magnetized armor; only dispel magic or a similar spell can release the stuck items. At the end of the spell's duration, the stuck items are released.<br />Paralysis from the orb causes the victim to become paralyzed for 6-20 (2d8 + 4) rounds; a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation halves the number of rounds.<br />Petrification from the orb turns the victim to stone. If the victim successfully saves vs. petrification, he avoids turning to stone and instead is slowed (as per the spell) for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. Death from the orb causes the victim to die. If the victim successfully saves. vs death magic, he avoids death and instead is paralyzed for 2-5 (1d4 +1) rounds.<br />Chromatic Orb Effects<br /><table><tr><th>Level of Caster</th><th>Color of Orb Generated</th><th>Hit Points of Damage</th><th>Special Power</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>White</td><td>1-4</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Red</td><td>1-6</td><td>Heat</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Orange</td><td>1-8</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Yellow</td><td>1-10</td><td>Blindness</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Green</td><td>1-12</td><td>Stinking Cloud</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Turquoise</td><td>2-8</td><td>Magnetism</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Blue</td><td>2-16</td><td>Paralysis</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Violet</td><td>slow</td><td>Petrification</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Black</td><td>paralysis</td><td>Death</td></tr></table>"

Written material can be read at the rate of one page or equivalent per round. Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (the 3rd-level secret page and illusionary script spells), and it does not reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.<br />The material components of this spell are a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.

The spell is not blocked by lead or any other substance. However, if an impenetrable obstacle is reached, such as the ground or a wall, the branch presses against it and stops.

It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. It grows by up to 10% per level of experience of the wizard, increasing this amount in height, width, and weight.<br />All equipment worn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.<br />Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge sword +1 is still only +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.<br />For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.<br />The reverse spell, reduce, negates the enlarge spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less than 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.<br />For example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or<br />7.2 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it, but an object will shrink only as long as the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron."

The wizard cannot increase his movement further by any means, including additional movement-affecting magical spells or items. Kerith was also noted for his cynical observation to a companion: «I don’t have to outrun the troll. I just have to outrun you.»"

			"body": "This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come.<br />The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened senses of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).<br />The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic--while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communications to its master would be tinged with fear of the \"big ones\" it was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.<br />If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizard's saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.<br />The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a dispel magic spell send them away.<br />Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.<br /><table><tr><th>D20 Roll</th><th>Familiar*</th><th>Sensory Powers</th></tr><tr><td>1-5</td><td>Cat, black</td><td>Excellent night vision, superior hearing</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Crow</td><td>Excellent vision</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Hawk</td><td>Very superior distance vision</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>Owl</td><td>Night vision equals human daylight vision, superior hearing</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>Toad</td><td>Wide-angle vision</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>Weasel</td><td>Superior hearing, very superior olfactory power</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>None</td><td>No familiar available within spell range</td></tr></table><br />* The DM can substitute other small animals suitable to the area."

The spell provides a wizard with an instant and highly accurate estimate of the number of persons or objects in a group.<br />The spell's area of effect is one group of a general class of objects. All objects of the group must be within spell range and the group as a whole must be visible to the caster. The wizard need not see every individual in the group, merely the general limits of the group's size and area. For example, a wizard on a hill could look down on a forest and estimate the number of trees in all or part of it. He could not get an estimate of the number of goblins within the forest, however, since the group as a whole (the goblins) is concealed from sight.<br />The estimate generated is accurate to the largest factor of ten (rounded up). For example, if Hornung's guess were cast on a group of 439 horsemen, the estimate would be 400. If there were 2,670 horsemen, the spell would estimate 3,000. If there were 37 horsemen, the answer would be 40. Clearly, using the spell on small groups (especially those with fewer than 10 members) is pointless. Hornung's guess can be used to quickly estimate the size of treasure hoards and army units. It is particularly popular with moneylenders and generals."

If any attempt at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.<br />The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determined. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% of the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged ring of three wishes always appears to be only faintly charged.<br />After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).<br />The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl feather steeped in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent: Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might also be learned."

Reassembling a shredded map may be easy; reassembling a broken clock is significantly more difficult; rebuilding a shattered mosaic is extremely difficult.

The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wizard's saving throws against attacks that are basically frontal.

The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. The creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are ignored.<br />For example, a wizard casts sleep at three kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll (2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one gnoll are affected (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3 1/2 Hit Dice).

Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, it can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. When cast at a creature, the target gets a saving throw vs. spell; success indicates that the spell affects the space about 1 foot behind the creature instead. Note that this spell can also blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the creature's visual organs, reducing its attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.<br />A continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of continual light against a similar or weaker magical darkness cancels both.<br />The reverse spell continual darkness is a Shadow school spell, which shadow casters may not reverse into continual light.<br />This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in the typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials can last hundreds or even thousands of years."

Note, however, that light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).<br />The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first. Note that the priest spells bless, chant, and prayer are not attacks for this purpose. All highly Intelligent (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels of experience have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible object).<br />The material components of the invisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the former encased in the latter."

Creatures with very thick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, elephants, scaled creatures, etc.) are basically unaffected. There are two versions of the spell, either of which can be cast from the standard preparation:<br />Itching. When cast, this causes each subject to feel an instant itching sensation on some portion of its body. If one round is not immediately spent scratching the irritated area, the creature is so affected that the next three rounds are spent squirming and twisting, effectively worsening its Armor Class by 4 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. Spell preparations are ruined in the first round this spell is in effect, but not in the following three rounds. Doing nothing but scratching the itch for a full round prevents the rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, the saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at two creatures, the saving throw has a -1 penalty; and if cast at three or four creatures, the saving throw is normal.<br />Rash. When a rash is cast, the subject notices nothing for 1d4 rounds, but thereafter its entire skin breaks out in red welts that itch. The rash persists until either a cure disease or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It lowers Charisma by 1 point per day for each of four days (i.e., maximum Charisma loss is 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is lowered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish immediately upon the removal of the rash, and all statistics return to normal. This can be cast at one creature only, with a saving throw penalty of -2.<br />The material component for this spell is a leaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac."

In all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds--although the former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area; a 3rd-level wizard can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). Each spell can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. In all cases, the location of the door or item must be known--the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes of discovering a secret door.<br />The reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot affect a portcullis."

If the spell is cast upon the wizard, he can move vertically up or down at a movement rate of 2 per round.

A levitating creature attempting to use a missile weapon finds himself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, the third -3, etc., up to a maximum of -5.

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated--if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.<br />The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak \"to the first creature that touches you,\" or \"to the first creature that passes within 30 feet.\" Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: \"Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot.\" Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards.\"). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.<br />The material component of this spell is a small bit of honeycomb."

The hand attempts to grasp the creature's leg. The victim must attempt a saving throw; if successful, the hand sinks into the ground. Each round thereafter (until the spell ends or the target moves out of spell range), the hand has a 5% chance per level of the caster of reappearing beneath the targeted creature, at which time another saving throw is required.<br />If a saving throw is missed, the earthen limb firmly grasps and holds the creature in place. An individual held by the hand suffers a movement rate of 0, Armor Class penalty of -2, and attack penalty of -2. All Dexterity combat bonuses are negated. The hand causes no physical damage to the victim.<br />The arm may be attacked by any creature, including the arm's victim.

The rope can be taken into the extradimensional space if fewer than eight persons have climbed it; otherwise, it simply stays hanging in the air (extremely strong creatures might be able to remove it, at the DM's option). Spells cannot be cast across the interdimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if there were a 3-foot x 5-foot window centered on the rope. The persons in the extradimensional space must climb down prior to the end of the spell, or they are dropped from the height at which they entered the extradimensional space. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. Note that the rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Also note that creating or taking extradimensional spaces into an existing extradimensional space is hazardous.<br />The material components of this spell are powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment."

This means that melee attacks against the wizard automatically miss if initiative indicates they fall after he has blinked.<br />Each round the spell is in effect, the wizard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the blink--the result of the dice roll is used as the wizard's initiative for that round. The wizard disappears and instantaneously reappears 10 feet distant from his previous position. (Direction is determined by a roll of 1d8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right behind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = left, 7 = left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster cannot blink into a solid object; if such is indicated, reroll the direction. Movable objects of size and mass comparable to the caster are shoved aside when the caster blinks in. If blinking is impossible except into a fixed, solid object, the caster is then trapped on the Ethereal Plane.<br />During each round that he blinks, the spellcaster can be attacked only by opponents who win initiative or by those who are able to strike both locations at once (for example, with a breath weapon, fireball, or similar wide-area attack forms). Opponents with multiple attacks, or those operating under haste or similar effects, can often strike early enough to have at least one attack against the caster.<br />If the spellcaster holds off his attack (if any) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until the blink is added to his normal 1d10 initiative roll (thus, he probably attacks last in the round). The spellcaster can also try to get his attack in before he blinks (he must announce his intent before rolling the 2d8 for blink timing and the 1d10 for initiative). In this case, the caster compares the two dice rolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower than his blink roll (the two rolls are not added if he is trying to attack before he blinks). If so, he attacks according to his initiative roll, then blinks according to the blink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his initiative roll, however, he blinks first and then attacks in whatever direction he's facing (he must go through with his attack, even if he is facing in the wrong direction to affect anyone)."

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).<br />Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.<br />A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed.

The fireball fills an area equal to its normal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 cubic feet--thirty-three 10-foot x 10-foot x 10-foot cubes). Besides causing damage to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball.<br />The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast.

A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (for example, if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of the bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt may set fire to combustibles, sunder wooden doors, splinter up to a half-foot thickness of stone, and melt metals with a low melting point (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). Saving throws must be rolled for objects that withstand the full force of a stroke (see the fireball spell). If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the bolt continues. A bolt can breach 1 inch of wood or half an inch of stone per caster level, up to a maximum of 1 foot of wood or half a foot of stone.<br />The lightning bolt's area of effect is chosen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt 10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt 5 feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt cannot reach its full length, because of an unyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the lightning bolt rebounds from the barrier toward its caster, ending only when it reaches its full length.<br />For example: An 80-foot-long stroke is begun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone wall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits the wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back toward its creator (who is only 50 feet from the wall, and so is caught in his own lightning bolt!).<br />The DM might allow reflecting bolts. When this type of lightning bolt strikes a solid surface, the bolt reflects from the surface at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (like light off a mirror). A creature crossed more than once by the bolt must roll a saving throw for every time it is crossed, but it still suffers either full damage (if one saving throw is missed) or half damage (if all saving throws are made).<br />The material components of the spell are a bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod."

He also is empowered with the ability to inflict this rotting disease on others by touch for the duration of the spell.<br />Mummy rot causes the flesh of the victim to putrify and decay. This causes a loss of 2 points of Charisma per month and is fatal in 1-6 months if untreated. Mummy rot can be cured by cure disease and more powerful magics which duplicate cure disease. While under the effects of mummy rot, the victim cannot be healed using cure light wounds, cure serious wounds or heal spells and normal healing takes place at 10% of the regular rate.<br />The caster’s appearance does not change as a result of this new ability and no other abilities are altered or improved other than the two noted above. The mummy touch affects everyone the caster touches during the duration of the spell. The caster can choose to end the spell prematurely, but once ended, the abilities are lost.<br />Undead are immune to the effects of mummy touch, as are other creatures who would not normally be affected by the attack of a mummy (such of iron golem or xorn). Mummy touch cannot be granted to another individual. The disease functions only by direct touch – it cannot be used to “poison” food or drink. The caster can be damaged normally by mummies, but if slain will not rot. Those slain by the caster using mummy touch will not rot as well.<br />The material components of this spell are a pinch of mummy dust and drop of blood."

The caster will see the new form (or not see the invisible individual), but will still see the mark.<br />The mark can be placed from a distance on any visible surface of the flesh or the object. It emits a glow visible to the caster (and his servants) in the dark. The recipient can be unaware that the caster has placed the mark, but is allowed a saving throw. A successful save indicates that the individual is not market by the nightscar.<br />In addition to the caster, up to seven others can see the nightscar on its target. These individuals are usually in contact with the caster at the time of the casting. Alternately, the caster can hold up to seven gems, stones or seeds in his hand. Each of those seeds, given to an individual, allows that individual to see the nightscar on the target.<br />Once placed, the scar cannot be detected by magic but it can be seen by a detect invisible spell. A true seeing or similar magic would miss the scar as it is not really there. The mark will fade upon the duration of the spell elapsing, and a dispel magic or remove curse will destroy the nightscar as well.<br />This spell is often used in cities to keep track of thieves and other individuals for later contact and/or arrest. It is particularly useful in trailing individuals who can charge their shape or appearance. The nightscar is believed to have been originally developed to track lycanthropes in their human form."

Each round, the victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.<br />Against flesh, the solvent is much less effective; it is caustic and burns painfully, inflicting 1 point of damage per caster level in the first round, but no further damage in the second or third round. However, the burning in the following rounds does inflict a –2 penalty to the victim’s attacks while the solvent is active. The solvent is extremely likely to cause extensive damage to the victim’s armor and equipment; item saving throws vs. acid may apply at the DM’s discretion. If the armor or equipment is magical in nature, then the saving throw is made with the usual bonuses allowed to the magical item.<br />The great alchemist Vandarien developed his solvent to dissolve iron grates, stone and woodwork traps, and other such hazards. The solvent’s effectiveness against mineral or wood-based creatures was a mere side effect of his research.

The creature to be influenced must, of course, be able to understand the wizard's suggestion--it must be spoken in a language that the spell recipient understands.<br />The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the action sound reasonable; asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking the wizard's party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.<br />The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed. If the target successfully rolls its saving throw, the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion causes the saving throw to be made with a penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of the DM.

The wall lasts as long as the wizard chooses to concentrate on maintaining it or one round per level if the wizard chooses not to concentrate on holding it together. The caster may shape the wall of water in one of three ways:<br />A. Water Curtain. In this form, the wizard conjures one plane of water, 5 feet square and 1 foot thick, per experience level; for example, a 5th-level caster can create five 5-foot x 5-foot x 1-foot wall sections that would be enough to block an arched passageway 15 feet wide and 10 feet high with a curtain of water 1 foot thick. The curtain’s lower edge must rest upon the ground, but it need not be anchored on either side, and it remains cohesive and upright for the duration of the spell. Once raised, the wall cannot be moved.<br />B. Hemisphere. In this manifestation, the wall of water forms a dome 1 foot thick over the caster, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level; a 7th-level caster could create a dome with a 10-foot radius. The wall must rest upon the ground. The dome is immobile.<br />C. Sphere. If cast underwater, the caster may shape the wall of water into a sphere 1 foot thick, with an inner radius equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level (no air is in the sphere). The sphere is centered on the caster and moves with him.<br />In any form, the wall of water has two primary effects. First of all, missile fire through the wall is next to impossible, suffering a –4 attack penalty for each foot of thickness as well as a –1 damage penalty for every two feet of thickness. Creatures gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attack spells that must pass through the wall. If the spell allows no saving throw, none is granted by the wall of water. Secondly, physical passage through the wall is hindered; any creature trying to pass through must take one full round to do so and becomes soaked to the skin in the process.<br />The wall of water can be defeated or bypassed by a number of spells or effects. At the end of the spell’s duration, the water loses its cohesiveness and collapses, which may surprise those sheltering under the hemisphere or standing next to the curtain. Note that the water itself may be fresh water (25% chance), salt water (50% chance), or brackish (25% chance), although the sphere will always be composed of the water type that surrounds it. The material component is a vial full of blessed spring water."

The first creature whose reflection is cast on the surface of the liquid releases the spell. When the spell is triggered, the liquid immediately forms an exact three-dimensional image of the reflected creature. If more than one creature casts a reflection simultaneously, only one watery double forms. Each creature has an equal chance of being the victim of the spell (roll randomly). The size of the watery double is restricted by the volume of fluid available. If the spell were cast on a full mug of ale, the double would form from the ale, becoming a mug-sized duplicate of the victim. The watery double will never exceed the actual size of the victim regardless of the size of the body of liquid.<br />When the spell is cast on the liquid, its duration is considered permanent until the power is released by a creature's reflection. The liquid will not evaporate until the spell is triggered. When the watery double forms, it remains animated for 1 round per experience level of the caster, to a maximum of 10 rounds.<br />The watery double attempts to touch the creature it has duplicated. It can affect only the creature that it resembles. It has the same THAC0 and current hit points as the creature it duplicates, but cannot cast spells or use any of the creature's magical items or special abilities. The watery double is AC 6 and its movement rate is double that of the victim. It may seep under doors and through cracks.<br />If the watery double succeeds in touching the creature, it merges with the individual, covering his entire body in a skin of liquid. The victim must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature has resisted the spell's effect and the watery double \"dies,\" becoming normal fluid (and soaking the creature in the process). If the saving throw is failed, the watery double begins forcing its way into the victim's body, inflicting 1d8 points of damage per round until it is destroyed.<br />The watery double dissipates if reduced to zero hit points or when the spell's duration expires. Striking the watery double while it is wrapped around its victim causes an equal amount of damage to the victim. Part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust spells instantly destroy a<br />watery double."

He can sense if a nonspellcaster has the potential to learn and cast wizard spells (e.g., whether a fighter will someday gain the ability to cast a spell).<br />Although a spellcaster's level cannot be discerned, the wizard can see the intensity of a spellcaster's aura and guess at the individual's magical power (dim, faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming). This can be extremely ambiguous even when a wizard has some method of comparison; the DM might announce that a subject's intensity is roughly equivalent to that of a companion, or he might announce that a subject's aura is the strongest the wizard has ever encountered.<br />An object's magical abilities cannot be discerned.

Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling him to \"sweep\" areas for the duration of the spell.<br />When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a saving throw. If this is failed, the identity and general location of the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The general location is a direction and significant landmark close to the scryer. Thus, the caster might learn, \"The wizard Sniggel spies on us from east, under the stairs,\" or, \"You are watched by Asquil in the city of Samarquol.\"<br />The material components for this spell are a small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet."

In later rounds the caster can expand an existing hole or start a new one. The material thrown from the excavation scatters evenly around the pit. If the wizard continues downward past 20 feet in earth, there is a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This check is made for every 5 feet dug beyond 20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, mud fills in and collapses after 5 feet, and quicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug.<br />Any creature at the edge (within 1 foot) of a pit must roll a successful Dexterity check or fall into the hole. Creatures moving rapidly toward a pit dug immediately before them must roll a saving throw vs. spell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a pit being excavated can climb out at a rate decided by the DM. A creature caught in a collapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. death to avoid being buried; it escapes the pit if successful. Tunneling is possible with this spell as long as there is space available for the material removed. Chances for collapse are doubled and the safe tunneling distance is half of the safe excavation depth, unless such construction is most carefully braced and supported.<br />The spell is also effective against creatures of earth and rock, particularly clay golems and those from the Elemental Plane of Earth. When cast upon such a creature, it suffers 4d6 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half.<br />To activate the spell, the spellcaster needs a miniature shovel and tiny bucket and must continue to hold them while each pit is excavated. These items disappear at the conclusion of the spell."

If the change is extreme (for example, a grassy plain covering a seething field of volcanic mudpots), the illusion will no doubt be noticed the instant one person falls prey to it. Each level of experience expands the dimensions of the cubic area affected by 10 yards; for example, a 12th-level caster affects an area 120 yds. x 120 yds. x 120 yds.<br />The material components of this spell are a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant--a leaf or grass blade."

Lastly, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to the spellcaster.<br />The inside of the shelter contains rude furnishings as desired by the spellcaster--up to eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, as many as four chairs or eight stools, and a writing desk.<br />The material components of this spell are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood.

The lesser geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that will result in certain death, although the wizard can use the spell to coerce the subject into almost any other nondestructive course of action. The victim is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the lesser geas, but suffers a –2 penalty on its save if the wizard is of higher level or Hit Dice, or a –4 penalty if the wizard is more than twice the victim’s level or Hit Dice.<br />The wizard must be careful in the wording of his lesser geas since the casting and fulfillment are tricky. The subject should be given a tangible, achievable goal, with clear courses of action available to him. «Climb that mountain!» or «Tear that mountain down rock by rock!» are legitimate geases, but a geas such as «Become a mountain!» is just not specific enough to work.<br />Similar to the 6th-level spell geas, the lesser geas compels the subject to obey the wizard’s command. If the geased creature fails to follow the wizard’s instructions, it will grow sick—each week that passes, the creature loses one point from each ability score, 1 hit point per Hit Die, and suffers a cumulative –1 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws. These penalties cannot reduce an ability score to less than 3, reduce a creature to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die, or reduce its attacks and saves by more than 4 points. The lesser geas can be countermanded by a remove curse spell, or a limited wish or wish.

This roll has a -1 penalty for every four levels of the caster.<br />Special modifiers apply to this attack:<br /><table><tr><th>Condition</th><th>Modifier</th></tr><tr><td>Surprise</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Subject previously attacked by this spell</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Subject is an illusionist</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Subject is wearing a helm of telepathy</td><td>+3</td></tr></table><br />Magic resistance, bonuses against fear, and Wisdom adjustments also apply. The subject's magic resistance is checked first; if the spell overcomes the resistance, the subject's fear/Wisdom bonuses (if any) then apply as negative modifiers to his Intelligence check.<br />If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon the wizard, who must then disbelieve it or be subject to its attack and possible effects.<br />If the subject ignores the killer to perform other actions, such as attacking the caster, the killer may, at the DM's option, gain bonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, etc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak of bravery, cast after the killer has attacked, grant another check to disbelieve the effect."

			"body": "The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that completely alters the form and ability, and possibly the personality and mentality, of the recipient. Of course, while a creature with a lower Intelligence can be polymorphed in form into something with a higher Intelligence, it will not gain that creature's mental ability. The reverse--polymorphing a higher Intelligence creature into one of significantly lower Intelligence--results in a creature much more intelligent than appearances would lead one to believe. The polymorphed creature must succeed on a system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it survives the change. After this, it must make a special Intelligence check to see if it retains its personality (see following).<br />The polymorphed creature acquires the form and physical abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into, while retaining its own mind. Form includes natural Armor Class (that due to skin toughness, but not due to quickness, magical nature, etc.), physical movement abilities (walking, swimming, and flight with wings, but not plane shifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and attack routines (claw/claw/bite, swoop, rake, and constriction, but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit points and saving throws do not change from the original form. Noncorporeal forms cannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters (lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level druids, etc.) are affected for but one round, and can then resume their normal form.<br />If slain, the polymorphed creature reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. (Note that most creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!) As class and level are not attributes of form, abilities derived from either cannot be gained by this spell, nor can exact ability scores be specified.<br />When the polymorph occurs, the creature's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The creature retains its mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. Creatures not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, -2 to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.<br />When the physical change occurs, there is a base 100% chance that the subject's personality and mentality change into that of the new form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on 1d20). For each 1 point of Intelligence of the subject, subtract 1 from the base chance on 1d20. Additionally, for every Hit Die of difference between the original form and the form it is assuming, add or subtract 1 (depending on whether polymorphed form has more Hit Dice [or levels] or fewer Hit Dice [or levels] than original, respectively). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form is checked daily until the change takes place.<br />A subject acquiring the mentality of the new form has effectively become the creature whose form was assumed and comes under the control of the DM until recovered by a wish spell or similar magic. Once this final change takes place, the creature acquires the new form's full range of magical and special abilities.<br />For example: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 Hit Dice, it is 85% (20 - 8 Intelligence + 5 level difference [6-1] = 17 out of 20 = 85%) likely to actually become one in all respects, but in any case it has the dragon's physical and mental capabilities. If it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon, it knows what it formerly knew as well.<br />The wizard can use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form, and this requires a system shock roll. Those who have lost their individuality and are then converted back maintain the belief that they are actually the polymorphed creature and attempt to return to that form. Thus, the orc who comes to believe he is a white dragon, when converted back to his orc form, steadfastly maintains he is really a white dragon polymorphed into the shape of an orc. His companions will most likely consider him mad.<br />The material component of this spell is a caterpillar cocoon."

The spell does not give the new form's other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.<br />When the polymorph occurs, the caster's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively).

Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable normal movement. The spellcaster can change his form as often as desired for the duration of the spell, each change requiring a round. The wizard retains his own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. The wizard can end the spell at any time; when voluntarily returning to his own form and ending the spell, he regains 1d12 hit points. The wizard also will return to his own form when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are restored in these cases."

The actual hit point total for each monster is 20% of the hit point total it would normally have. (To determine this, roll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply the hit points by .2. Any remainder less than .4 is dropped--in the case of monsters with 1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the monster was not successfully created--and scores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 hit point.)<br />Those viewing the shadow monsters are allowed to disbelieve as per normal illusions, although there is a -2 penalty to the attempt. The shadow monsters perform as the real monsters with respect to Armor Class and attack forms. Those who believe in the shadow monster suffer real damage from their attacks. Special attack forms such as petrification or level drain do not actually occur, but a subject who believes they are real will react appropriately.<br />Those who roll successful saving throws see the shadow monsters as transparent images superimposed on vague shadowy forms. These are Armor Class 10 and inflict only 20% of normal melee damage (biting, clawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional damage less than .4 as done with hit points.<br />For example: A shadow monster griffon attacks a person who knows it is only quasi-real. The monster strikes with two claw attacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die monster. All three attacks hit; the normal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2 separately, rounded up or down, and added together to get the total damage. Thus, if the attacks score 4, 2 and 11 points, a total of 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = .8 [rounded to 1], 2 x .2 = .4 [rounded to 1], 11 x .2 = 2.2 [rounded to 2].

When the spell is cast, the nearest lycanthrope (as determined by the DM) of the chosen species must attempt a saving throw. If successful, the creature is unaffected. If it fails, the lycanthrope instantly appears near the caster.<br />Upon arrival, the creature can freely attack the wizard unless the caster has created a warding circle. If a circle is present, the lycanthrope appears in the circle; otherwise, it appears 1d10 feet away from the caster in a random direction (the DM should use the scatter diagram for grenadelike missiles found in the DUNGEON MASTER® Guide to determine direction).<br />A warding circle is a temporary prison drawn with specially prepared pigments laced with silver filings. These pigments cost 100 gp for each foot of diameter of the circle (thus, a circle 10 feet across costs 1,000 gp). A warding circle must be at least 5 feet in diameter; if smaller, the lycanthrope is automatically freed. Preparing the circle takes one turn per foot of diameter.<br />Even with such protection, the lycanthrope can break out of the circle and wreak vengeance upon the summoner. The creature's base chance of success is 20%, modified by the difference between its Hit Dice and the wizard's experience level. If the spellcaster is of a higher level, the difference is subtracted from the creature's chance of escaping the circle. If the lycanthrope is of higher Hit Dice than the wizard's level, the difference is added to its chance. Each creature is allowed only one attempt to escape.<br />Any break in the circle spoils the power of the spell and enables the lycanthrope to break free. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature cannot take any action against any portion of the ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents this.<br />Once safely ensnared, the lycanthrope can be held for as long as the summoner dares. The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the magical barrier. When the full moon sets, the lycanthrope reverts to its human form. At this time, it is free of the spell and may leave the circle.<br />The material components are a drop of blood from any animal, a human hair, and a moonstone worth at least 150 gp. If the caster elects to create the warding circle, the components described above are also required."

The spell can be cast only upon nonliving objects and can affect only materials within a 10'x10'x10' cube.<br />Objects in the area of effect either remain normal and visible or they disappear (50% chance). The state of existence for any object is determined randomly and changes with each viewing and viewer. Thus, a single object could appear and disappear several times during the course of the spell. Furthermore, it might be \"there\" for one onlooker, but \"not there\" for another.<br />For example, a wild mage casts this spell on a doorway. The DM rolls percentile dice and determines the door is \"there\" for the wizard. The wizard's companion also looks at the door. The DM rolls and determines that the door is \"not there\" for the companion. The pair studies the door for several minutes, during which time the door does not change (this counts as a single viewing for each character).<br />The wizard and his companion then close their eyes. When they look at the door again, new checks for each character reveal the door is \"not there\" for both characters. The pair steps through the open archway and turns around to look at the door once again. This time it is \"not there\" for the wizard, but \"there\" for his companion. This random changing continues throughout the duration of the spell.<br />Objects that are \"there\" are normal in all respects. Doors can be opened, chests can be picked up and carried, and rocks can be used as barricades. Objects that are \"not there\" are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a \"not there\" wall without difficulty.<br />When two parties perceive a there/not there object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as \"there.\" Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as \"not there\" and fires arrows at the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short. The fighter would be subject to a check before firing each arrow to determine whether his perception changes (assume that the fighter must look away from the rock every time he nocks an arrow; each time he takes aim, this counts as a new viewing).<br />After the spell is cast, any objects removed from the area of effect retain their uncertain existence for the duration of the spell. Thus, a pair of heroes could pick up a treasure chest, carry it down the hall, set it down, and discover it had vanished while their backs were turned. Worse still, one might see the chest and the other not! The material component is a small piece of cat fur sealed inside a small box."

The thunderlance can also be willed out of existence by the caster at any time without hitting anyone. The thunderlance will disappear without inflicting any damage if the caster dies, loses consciousness, or casts any other spells. Full conscious control is not necessary to command the thunderlance, allowing the mage to move and fight normally while carrying the lance.<br />The lance can be used as a barrier or a trap against attacking creatures, but is most often used as a weapon. The lance attacks creatures at thier lowest unarmored armor class (a dragon would still be AC 2 but a mounted knight would be AC 10). Any non-inate armor is ignored, but dexterity and magical bonuses do apply to the target’s armor class.<br />The touch of a thunderlance will destroy a shield spell, a wall of force, a minor globe of invulnerability, and similar minor abjuration magics of 5th level or less. Higher level abjuration spells are unaffected by the thunderlance. In either case, the thunderlance is discharged and fades upon striking such a magical barrier. It can pass through fire and water (including ice) unharmed, even if the fire, water, or ice is the result of magic spells.<br />As a bonus, the thunderlance absorbs magic missiles directed at the wielder and for every magic missile so absorbed, the lance will inflict 2-5 additional points of damage when discharged. The thunderlance can absorb and then discharge one magic missile for every three levels of the caster. Additional magic missiles are absorbed but do not increase its discharge. “Magic missiles” include other spells with similar properties, such as major missile and Snilloc’s snowball, Each of these spells, if absorbed in the thunderlance, inflicts 2-5 more points of damage, regardless of the typical damage of the spell.<br />The material component of this spell is a small, silver spear."

Only the caster may throw the pebble.<br />The wizard can enchant one stone at 7th level and gains one stone per three levels of experience thereafter (two stones at 10th level, three at 13th level, etc.). Only one pebble may be thrown per round, and pebbles must be hurled in consecutive rounds. The spell has a duration in rounds equal to the number of pebbles enchanted. Each pebble requires a separate attack roll. Pebbles may be thrown at different targets within range.<br />The material components are pebbles, which revert to normal size when the spell expires.<br />The reverse of this spell, turn boulder to pebble, shrinks a boulder to the size of a pebble. It affects only naturally occurring rocks and can not be used to shrink a statue or a cut gemstone.<br />The number of rocks that may be affected is equal to the number of experience levels of the caster. Boulders must not exceed one cubic foot per level of the caster. Thus, a 10th-level wizard could shrink 10 rocks, each of which is equal to or less than 10 cubic feet in size. All rocks are affected in the same round the spell is cast. Though they need not be touched, the boulders must be within 50 feet of the caster. Boulders that have been shrunk remain so until dispelled."

Failure means they believe that the objects are invisible. A dispel magic spell cancels this spell so that the true area is seen. A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, and similar effects can penetrate the deception, but a detect invisibility spell cannot.<br />This spell is a very powerful combination of invisibility and illusion, but it can cloak only nonliving things. Living things are not made invisible, but their presence does not otherwise disturb the spell.<br />The wizard must have a square of the finest black silk to cast this spell.

In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to catch a moving creature with a newly-created wall of fire is difficult; a successful saving throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which side of the created wall it is on.

When this spell is cast, a sheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall is primarily defensive, stopping pursuers and the like. The wall is 1 inch thick per level of experience of the wizard. It covers a 10-foot-square area per level (a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.). Any creature breaking through the ice suffers 2 points of damage per inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using creatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, while cold-using creatures suffer only 1 point of damage per inch when breaking through. The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored along one or more sides.<br />B) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell creates a hemisphere whose maximum radius is equal to 3 feet plus 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7thlevel caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or melted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents under the hemisphere.<br />C) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell causes a horizontal sheet to fall upon opponents. The sheet covers a 10-foot-square area per caster level. The sheet has the same effect as an ice storm's hail stones--3d10 points of damage inflicted to creatures beneath it.<br />A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures; its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Magical fires such as fireballs and fiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one round, though this creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires or lesser magical ones do not hasten the melting of a wall of ice.<br />The material component of this spell is a small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."

Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye, although it can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole (1 inch in diameter).<br />Using the eye requires the wizard to concentrate. However, if his concentration is broken, the spell does not end--the eye merely becomes inert until the wizard again concentrates, subject to the duration of the spell.

Affected creatures react as follows:<br /><table><tr><th>D10 Roll</th><th>Action</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wander away (unless prevented) for duration of spell</td></tr><tr><td>2-6</td><td>Stand confused for one round (then roll again)</td></tr><tr><td>7-9</td><td>Attack nearest creature for one round (then roll again)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Act normally for one round (then roll again)</td></tr></table><br />The spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those affected are checked by the DM for actions each round for the duration of the spell, or until the \"wander away for the duration of the spell\" result occurs.<br />Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible using their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.<br />The material component for this spell is a small disc of bronze and a small rod of iron."

Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell.

A moderate breeze causes it to alter course (roll for direction), but it does not move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under water."

Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.<br />It is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell.

The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or until the spell's duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they are ever more than 60 yards from a large body of water.<br />The material component of the spell (besides the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:<br />Air Elemental--burning incense<br />Earth Elemental--soft clay<br />Fire Elemental--sulphur and phosphorus<br />Water Elemental--water and sand<br />Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell."

Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the wizard increases the probability of the spellcaster going insane or dying, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes.

The spell places the earth elemental in the area of effect, and the elemental then causes the area's dimensions to be either doubled or halved for those traveling over it (spellcaster's choice).

Unlike the lower-level spell, improved blink allows the wizard to choose the exact time of his jump, the exact destination, and the orientation or facing of his choosing. For example, a wizard confronted by an enemy fighter could blink just before the fighter attacked, reappearing directly behind his foe for a back attack. If the wizard blinks away from an attack, his enemy automatically misses—but creatures with multiple attacks may be able to reposition themselves for another swing if the wizard blinks to a location within reach.<br />If the wizard intends to take any action such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a magical item, he must decide before the round begins if he will do so before or after he blinks. If he acts before he blinks, he may be endangered by an attack before he finishes; he can choose to proceed with his action, hoping that he won’t be hit, or he can abort his action by taking his blink for the round. On the other hand, if the wizard begins his action after his blink, the initiative modifier of his attack or spell is added to the time of his blink to determine when he attacks.<br />A blinking wizard dueling a fighter decides to blink first, when the fighter attacks and then lightning bolt the offensive fellow. The fighter rolls a modified 6 for initiative, so the wizard waits until 6, then blinks, making the fighter miss. At that time, he starts his lightning bolt, which has a casting time of 3—the spell will go off on 9.<br />In the Player’s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics initiative system, the wizard must count 1, 2, or 3 phases from the time of his blink for fast, average, or slow actions. If the fighter above attacked in the average phase, the wizard would blink during the fighter’s attack, and then his lightning bolt (a fast spell) would go off 1 phase later, with any other slow actions.<br />Because the wizard can pick the location he is blinking to, he may not choose to blink into a movable object in order to force it aside—he must blink to an area clear of obstructions or obstacles. If he does attempt to blink into a movable object, he will find himself displaced to a random location (use the blink 1d8 rules in the PHB for determining where he ends up)."

The wizard must risk his own safety--the gate does not allow the use of probes, long-handled ladles, tongs, or other equipment to gather the material. The caster cannot move completely through the gate.<br />The gate vanishes when the spell's duration expires or when the target or the wizard moves more than 10' away from it.<br />The gate is visible from both sides, and other creatures can reach through the gate. Breath weapons, gaze attacks, missiles, spells, and similar attacks cannot be cast through the gate. Because creatures can pass their limbs through the gate, physical attacks and touch spells can be used.<br />The only limit to the range of this spell is that the caster and the target must be on the same plane of existence. Elemental forces (not creatures) will not pass through the gate. Thus, the wizard does not run the risk of flooding his laboratory by opening a gate beneath the sea, for example. However, the spell does not provide any sort of protection against a hostile environment.<br />The material components are an exquisite silver mirror of no less than 10,000 gp value and a black opal worth at least 1,000 gp which must be powdered and sprinkled on the mirror. The mirror is not lost after casting and may be used again, but the powdered opal is consumed in the casting."

It may appear as a house-sized boulder in rocky or mountainous areas, a sand dune, a deadfall, a small grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The spell also conceals all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within the lodge. Creatures or characters who are exceptionally well-tuned to their surroundings (elves, druids, rangers, and various sylvan monsters) may attempt a saving throw vs. spell to spot the hidden lodge if they pass within 30 feet; all other creatures cannot find the wizard’s refuge without the aid of true seeing or similar magic.<br />In all other respects, the hidden lodge resembles Leomund’s secure shelter. The interior is level, clean, and dry, and the whole thing is sturdily constructed from timber, stone, or sod. It is secure against winds of up to 100 miles per hour, impervious to normal missiles, and the doors, windows, and chimney have the option to be wizard locked and guarded by an alarm spell. Simple furnishings include up to ten bunks, a small writing desk, a trestle table and benches, and an optional unseen servant to wait on the wizard. (If any of the optional secondary spells are added on to this spell, then the casting time goes up to one hour and adds a +3 modifier to the subtlety rating.)<br />The material components are a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkle of water, and a splinter of wood, plus a crushed diamond worth at least 100 gold pieces. If the secondary spells are to be included, their material components are required also."

The large chest must be exceptionally well-crafted and expensive, constructed for the caster by master craftsmen. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be platinum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be electrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) made, so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One wizard can have but one pair of these chests at any given time--even wish spells do not allow exceptions! The chests themselves are nonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest.<br />While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica, the caster chants the spell. This causes the large chest to vanish into the Ethereal Plane. The chest can contain 1 cubic foot of material per level of the wizard no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell fails, so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books, magical items, gems, etc. As long as the spellcaster has the small duplicate of the magical chest, he can recall the large one from the Ethereal Plane whenever the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can return, although an expedition might be mounted to find it.<br />While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, there is a cumulative 1% chance per week that some being finds it. This chance is reset to 1% whenever the chest is recalled and the spell recast to return it to the Ethereal Plane. If the chest is found, the DM must work out the encounter and decide how the being reacts to the chest (for example, it might ignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, or even exchange or add to the items present!).<br />Whenever the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane, an ethereal window is opened for a variable amount of time (usually about one turn); the window slowly diminishes in size. When this hole opens between the planes, check for an ethereal encounter to see if a monster is drawn through.<br />If the large chest is not retrieved before the spell duration lapses, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is lost."

			"body": "The magic jar spell enables the caster to shift his life force into a special receptacle (a gem or large crystal). From there the caster can force an exchange of life forces between the receptacle and another creature, thus enabling the wizard to take over and control the body of another creature, while the life force of the host is confined in the receptacle. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the wizard's body at the time of spellcasting. The wizard's life force shifts into the receptacle in the round in which the casting is completed, allowing no other actions.<br />While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force within a 10-foot-per-level radius (on the same plane); however, the exact creature types and relative physical positions cannot be determined. In a group of life forces, the caster can sense a difference of four or more levels/Hit Dice and can determine whether a life force is positive or negative energy.<br />For example, if two 10th-level fighters are attacking a hill giant and four ogres, the caster could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within range, all with positive life energy. The caster could try to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but he has no control over exactly which creature is attacked.<br />An attempt to take over a host body requires a full round. It is blocked by a protection from evil spell or similar ward. It is successful only if the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell with a special modifier (see following). The saving throw is modified by subtracting the combined Intelligence and Wisdom scores of the target from those of the wizard (Intelligence and Hit Dice in nonhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This modifier is added to (or subtracted from) the die roll.<br /><table><tr><th>Difference</th><th>Die Adjustment</th></tr><tr><td>-9 or less</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>-8 to -6</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>-5 to -3</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>-2 to 0</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>+1 to +4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>+5 to +8</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>+9 to +12</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>+13 or more</td><td>-3</td></tr></table><br />A negative score indicates that the wizard has a lower total than the target; thus, the host has a saving throw bonus. Failure to take over the host leaves the wizard's life force in the magic jar.<br />If successful, the caster's life force occupies the host body and the host's life force is confined in the magic jar receptacle. The caster can call upon rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its real or acquired knowledge (i.e., the wizard does not automatically know the language or spells of the creature). The caster retains his own attack rolls, class knowledge and training, and any adjustments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If the host body is human or humanoid, and the necessary spell components are available, the wizard can even use his memorized spells. The host body retains its own hit points and physical abilities and properties. The DM decides if any additional modifications are necessary; for example, perhaps clumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the caster must become used to the new form. The alignment of the host or receptacle is that of the occupying life force.<br />The caster can shift freely from the host to the receptacle if within the 10-foot-per-level range. Each attempt to shift requires one round. The spell ends when the wizard shifts from the jar to his own body.<br />A successful dispel magic spell cast on the host can drive the caster of the magic jar spell back into the receptacle and prevent him from making any attacks for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of the dispel. The base success chance is 50%, plus or minus 5% per level difference between the casters. A successful dispel magic cast against the receptacle forces the occupant back into his own body. If the wizard who cast the magic jar is forced back into his own body, the spell ends.<br />If the host body is slain, the caster returns to the receptacle, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the host and the caster die.<br />Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, resurrection, or similar spell.<br />If the body of the caster is slain, his life force survives if it is in either the receptacle or the host. If the receptacle is destroyed while the caster's life force occupies it, the caster is irrevocably slain."

At 9th level, the wizard can proof an article of clothing or a small piece of furniture; at 12th level, a small vehicle or large piece of furniture; at 15th level, a small building or large vehicle; at 18th level, a medium building or a very large vehicle; and at 20th level or higher, a large building or small fortification. A character dressed in a completely proofed article of clothing (a large cloak) gains a +2 bonus to saving throws vs. fire.<br />The material component for proofing versus combustion is a fire-brick made with the ashes left from a phoenix’s fire.

Each of the eyes is about the size of a small apple and can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to the caster’s hand to replay in the caster’s mind everything they have seen during their existence. The eyes are subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect the wizard’s ability to receive visual information about his surroundings. The eyes only see as a normal human would—abilities and spell effects including infravision do not alter the eyes’ vision. It only takes the eye one round to replay one hour of recorded images.<br />The spell conjures 1d4 eyes, plus 1 eye per caster level. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level, or until they return to the wizard; after relaying its findings, an eye disappears. Each eye is AC 4, flies by levitation at a rate of 12, and has only 1 hit point—a single hit from any weapon or damaging spell destroys it. A successful dispel magic destroys all eyes caught in the area of effect. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot, especially in conditions of poor visibility such as darkness, fog, or rain. Of course, if the eye is being sent into darkness, then it’s very possible that it could hit a wall or other similar obstacle and destroy itself. When the wizard creates the eyes, he can specify any set of instructions or orders that he wishes, up to 25 words. Any knowledge the wizard possesses is assumed to be known by the eyes as well, so if the wizard knows what a typical Jakallian merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. Sample commands might be, «Surround me at a range of 400 yards and return if you spot any dangerous creatures,» or «Spread out and search the town for Arweth; follow him for three turns, staying out of sight, and then return.» Note that in the first command, the eye only returns if it spots a creature that the wizard would regard as dangerous; a seemingly innocuous peasant that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn’t trigger the eye’s return. In any event, if an eye is ever more than one mile distant from the wizard, it instantly ceases to exist. However, the wizard’s link with the eye is such that he won’t know if the eye was destroyed or if it just wandered out of range.<br />Some command words can be used to abbreviate the directions. For example, «surround me» directs the eyes to form an equally-spaced ring at whatever range is indicated, and then move with the wizard. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. «Spread out» directs the eyes to move away from the wizard in all directions. Other commands that might be useful include having them form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or have them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of the wizard’s directions.<br />The material component is a handful of crystal marbles."

If either creature enters a different plane, the spell is terminated.<br />Rary's telepathic bond can be cast only once to affect a single pair of subjects.

Iron and iron-based alloys such as steel, meteoric iron, mithral, and adamantite are affected, but noble metals such as gold, silver, and copper are not subject to reduction through rusting. Any ferrous metal touched by the wizard must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration (usually a 17 or better on a d20) or be destroyed. Magical arms or armor may apply their bonus to this save, so a sword +3 would gain a +3 to its roll. Other magical metal items may receive a +1 to a +6 bonus based on the DM’s estimate of their power.<br />The wizard may employ rusting grasp in combat by simply touching the equipment of metal-wearing characters or creatures. If he tries to touch the armor of a character, the wizard need only hit the opponents unarmored AC. If the armor fails its save, rusting grasp permanently destroys 2d4 points of AC through corrosion. For example, plate mail +3 (base AC 0) could be reduced to a base AC of 2 to 8 if it fails its item saving throw.<br />Weapons are more difficult to grasp; the wizard must make an attack roll against AC 4 (modified by the opponent’s Dexterity) in order to touch the weapon. If the weapon fails its saving throw, it is destroyed. Important note: The wizard must touch the weapon and not the other way around! Unlike a rust monster, he doesn’t corrode weapons simply by being hit.<br />Against metallic creatures, rusting grasp functions like the priest spell cause serious wounds in that it inflicts 2d8+1 point of damage per successful attack. The spell lasts for one round per level, and the wizard can make one touch attack per round. The material component is an antenna from a rust monster."

Missiles can easily be fired from behind the wall, and creatures of small size (less than 4 feet tall) can wriggle through openings in the wall at the rate of 10 feet per round. However, the wall has many sharp edges and creatures wriggling through it suffer 1-8 hit points of damage per 10 feet traveled.<br />If the spell is cast in an area occupied by creatures, the wall of bones appears everywhere except where the creatures stand. Creatures in the affected area suffer an immediate 2-16 (2d8) hit points of damage when the wall appears. The wall can be smashed by creatures wielding blunt weapons with a Strength of 18 or greater. Every 10 hit points of damage causes a 5 foot x 5 foot x 6 inch section of the wall to collapse. The wall of bones is unaffected by animate dead.<br />The material component for this spell is the branch of a withered tree taken from a cemetery"

This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is ¼-inch thick per level of experience of the spellcaster. The wizard is able to create an iron wall of up to 15 square feet per experience level; thus, a 12th-level wizard can create a wall of iron with an area of 180 square feet. The wizard can double the wall's area by halving its thickness.<br />If the caster desires, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush any creature beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction. This chance can be modified by a force of not less than 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass-each pound over 400 or Strength point over 30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the stronger side. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saving throws vs. death. Those who fail are killed. Huge and gargantuan creatures cannot be crushed by the wall.<br />The wall is permanent, unless successfully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a normal iron wall is subject to--rust, perforation, etc.<br />The material component of this spell is a small piece of sheet iron."

The wall of stone is 0.25 inch thick and up to 20 square feet per level of experience of the wizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12thlevel wizard can create a wall of stone 3 inches thick and up to 240 square feet in surface area (a 12-foot-wide and 20-foot-high wall, for example, to completely close a 10-foot x 16-foot passage). The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation (see the wall of iron spell); however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the area of effect by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create a span with a surface area of 200 square feet. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenelations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. The stone is permanent unless destroyed by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell, or by normal means such as breaking or chipping.<br />The material component is a small block of granite."

The spell affects a quantity of liquid no larger than the area of effect. If cast onto a larger body, such as an ocean or large lake, the spell affects only the water within the area of effect.<br />After casting waveform, the mage can form the water into any desired shape. The spell does not bind the liquid together in any fashion; it is still limited by its fluid properties and gravity. Thus, a mage could not use waveform to create a humanoid creature with arms and legs and direct it to walk across land. He could, however, create a roughly human shape with flowing arms that rises out of the water, crashes forward in a huge splash, then rises and repeats the process. Other possible shapes include gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, and troughs.<br />The shape takes one round to form, after which it can be maintained by concentration. The shape can be directed to move in any direction at the rate of 90 feet per round. If the waveform moves into or through a body of water, the form loses no intensity. However, if the wave is moved over dry ground, it loses one die of damage for every 10 feet crossed.<br />If propelled against a target, the waveform causes 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster to creatures in its path. The waveform can be directed against creatures on the surface or underwater. Those struck are allowed a saving throw; success indicates half damage.<br />If the victims are in or on a body of water, the shape will sweep them along. Creatures of small size are carried with the form, moving at its speed. Medium and large size creatures are swept along at half the water's speed. Creatures larger than this resist the movement. Those caught in the current can make a Strength check each round to swim free of the current.<br />Boats and ships are particularly vulnerable to the waveform. If the waveform is twice the size of the vessel or more, the ship must make a seaworthiness check (as described in Table 77 of the DMG ). Vessels passing the check suffer damage as described above, reducing seaworthiness ratings for future checks by 2d6 points until repairs are made. Alternatively, this spell can be cast directly at a single water-based creature--a water weird, water elemental, or other creature from the elemental plane of water. In this case, the spell causes 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster. The effect is instantaneous and the spell ends immediately after the attack is made.<br />The material component is a small, carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp. The oar disintegrates when the spell is cast."

Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magical items or spells within its confines. The area is also impervious to breath weapons, gaze or voice attacks, and similar special attack forms.<br />The antimagic shell also hedges out charmed, summoned, or conjured creatures. It cannot, however, be forced against any creature that it would keep at bay; any attempt to do so creates a discernible pressure against the barrier, and continued pressure will break the spell. Normal creatures (a normally encountered troll rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magical sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword. Note that creatures on their home plane are normal creatures there. Thus, on the Elemental Plane of Fire, a randomly encountered fire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this spell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of demigod or higher status are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.<br />Should the caster be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, parts of his person may be considered exposed, at the DM's option. A dispel magic spell does not remove the spell; the caster can end it upon command."

If the wizard employs the arrow of bone himself, he strikes with the THAC0 of a warrior of half his own level and a +3 bonus to his attack roll; if he gives it to someone else, the bone arrow merely confers a +1 bonus to hit. A creature struck by the weapon must make a saving throw vs. death magic or die; even if successful, the victim sustains normal damage for the missile, plus an additional number of points equal to the weapon’s maximum damage (for example, 1d6+6 for an arrow or javelin, or 1d3+3 for a dart). Unlike the death spell or finger of death, the victim can be raised or resurrected in any expedient manner.<br />The arrow of bone does not destroy undead or nonliving creatures outright. Instead, the arrow inflicts normal damage plus four times the missile’s normal maximum (1d6+24 for an arrow, 1d3+12 for a dart, and so on), or half that if the subject creature succeeds in its saving throw.<br />The material component is a powdered sliver of bone mixed with black dragon blood. The resulting mixture is used to paint runes on the weapon.

After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.<br />The chain can strike as many times (including the first object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can strike up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.<br />Direction is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor--an arc cannot exceed the spell's range. If the only possible arc is greater than the spell's range, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, even though no damage is taken. Note that it is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster!<br />The material components are a bit of fur, a piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and one silver pin for each experience level of the caster."

Animal life not immune to acid suffers damage according to the length of time it is exposed to the vapors of a death fog, as follows:<br />1st round: 1 point<br />2nd round: 2 points<br />3rd round: 4 points<br />4th and each succeeding round: 8 points<br />The death fog otherwise resembles the 2nd-level fog cloud spell: rolling, billowing vapors that can be moved only by a very strong wind. Any creature attempting to move through the death fog progresses at a rate of 1 foot per unit of normal movement rate per round. A gust of wind spell cannot affect it, but a fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire can burn it away in a single round.<br />The material components are a pinch of dried and powdered peas, powdered animal hoof, and strong acid of any sort (including highly distilled vinegar or acid crystals), which must be obtained from an alchemist."

Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected, but an individual slain in this manner might be brought back via a wish. The number of creatures that can be slain is a function of their Hit Dice.<br /><table><tr><th>Creatures' Hit Dice</th><th>Maximum # of Creatures Affected</th></tr><tr><td>Under 2</td><td>4d20</td></tr><tr><td>2 to 4</td><td>2d20</td></tr><tr><td>4+1 to 6+3</td><td>2d4</td></tr><tr><td>6+4 to 8+3</td><td>1d4</td></tr></table><br />If creatures of differing Hit Dice are attacked with a death spell, roll the dice (4d20) to determine how many creatures of under 2 Hit Dice are affected. If the number rolled is greater than the actual number of sub-2 Hit Dice creatures, apply the remainder of the roll to the higher Hit Dice creatures by consulting the following table.<br /><table><tr><th>Creatures' Hit Dice</th><th>Conversion Factor (CF)</th></tr><tr><td>Under 2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2 to 4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4+1 to 6+3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>6+4 to 8+3</td><td>20</td></tr></table><br />In other words, from the 4d20 roll subtract the number of creatures of less than 2 Hit Dice (these creatures die). If there are any remaining points from the 4d20 roll, subtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit Dice (these creatures also die). If this still doesn't use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 for each creature of 4+1 to 6+3 Hit Dice, and so on. Stop when all the creatures are dead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the remainder is less than half the CF of any remaining creatures. (If the remainder is one-half or more of the CF of a creature, that creature dies.)<br />For example, a mixed group of 20 goblins, eight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill giant, are caught in the area of a death spell. The 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of this eliminates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 kills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remaining 17 kills two ogres (10 points<br />to kill one ogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough to kill one more ogre). The other two ogres and the hill giant are unharmed.<br />A death spell does not affect lycanthropes, undead creatures, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material.<br />The material component of this spell is a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 1,000 gp."

The dimensional blade can slash through matter with as much effort as it takes to wave a stick through the air. Even stone and iron can be carved to pieces with ease. The spell can be cast on almost any hand-held slashing (type S) weapon, as well as a few thrown weapons of this type, such as the chakram, shuriken, or a hand axe.<br />Against creatures, the dimensional blade ignores any portion of Armor Class derived from armor itself; only magical and Dexterity adjustments affect the opponent’s AC. For example, a warrior in chain mail +2 with a Dexterity of 17 is normally AC 0, but against the dimensional blade he only applies the 3-point adjustment for Dexterity and the 2-point magical adjustment, for a total AC of 5. Creatures wearing purely magical armor (such as bracers of defense) may keep the full magical adjustment. Monsters with thick or toughened hides, such as dragons, may lose part of the Armor Class at the DM’s discretion. The weapon gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls in any event, but the wielder ignores any Strength-based combat adjustments—muscle power doesn’t help the blade at all.<br />The dimensional blade is also quite effective against inanimate objects. Any object with a diameter or thickness smaller than the blade’s length must make a saving throw vs. disintegration when struck, or be cleanly severed in twain. Larger objects can be sawed through or sliced away at the rate of about 5 cubic feet per round. It’s dangerous to attempt to disarm a dimensional blade; the weapon used must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration or be destroyed.<br />Finally, the blade is also effective against phased or ethereal creatures since part of its existence is forced into the Ethereal Plane. If the wielder has some way to detect creatures concealed in this way, the blade can strike and affect them normally, but without the power to negate Armor Class or other combat bonuses.<br />The wizard must touch the weapon to be affected by the spell, but afterward anyone may wield it. The material component for this spell is a razor-thin shard of glass."

			"body": "This is a spell that must be used by a wizard planning to create a magical item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic. The item must meet the following tests: 1) it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2) the item must be the finest possible, considering its nature, i.e., crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3) its cost or value must reflect the second test, and in most cases the item must have a raw-materials cost in excess of 100 gp. With respect to requirement 3, it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes, leather goods, cloth, and pottery not normally embroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or engraved. If such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions, however, these are required for the item to be enchanted.<br />The wizard must have access to a workshop or laboratory, properly equipped and from which contaminating magic can be screened. Any magical item not related to the fabrication process (such as most protective devices) and within 30 feet of the materials is a source of contaminating magic and will spoil the process.<br />The item to be prepared must be touched by the spellcaster. This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time, which is a base 16 hours plus an additional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never work more than eight hours per day, and haste or any other spells will not alter the time required in any way, this effectively means that casting time for this spell is two days + 1d8 days). All work must be uninterrupted, and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 foot distant from the spellcaster; if it is, the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again. (Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic can be performed, and the wizard must remain quiet and in isolation or the enchantment is ruined.)<br />At the end of the spell, the caster will know that the item is ready for the final test. He will then pronounce the final magical syllable, and if the item makes a saving throw (which is exactly the same as that of the wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. The spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also apply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on the 1d20 roll always results in failure, regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished, the wizard can begin to place the desired spell upon the item. The spell he plans to place must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades, and the item must be enchanted again.<br />Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 2d4 hours per spell level of the magic being cast. Again, during casting the item must be touched by the wizard, and during the rest periods it must always be within 1 foot of his person. This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item, and each successive spell must be begun within 24 hours of the last, even if the prior spell failed.<br />No magic placed on an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch. This always runs a 5% risk of draining 1 point of Constitution from the wizard casting the spell. Also, while it is possible to tell when the basic spell (enchant an item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually work, for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally, an item that is charged--a rod, staff, wand, javelin of lightning, ring of wishes, etc.--can never be made permanent. Magical devices cannot be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared, but scrolls can be used for this purpose.<br />The materials needed for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being enchanted and the magic to be cast upon it. For example, a cloak of displacement might require the hides of one or more displacer beasts, a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will be effective against, and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of ki-rin. These specifics, as well as other information pertaining to this spell, are decided by the DM and must be discovered or researched in play."

			"body": "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a powerful creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, where it will be held until it agrees to perform one service in return for freedom from the ensnarement spell. The type of creature to be ensnared must be known and stated, and if it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the ensnarement spell. The spell causes an awareness of a gatelike opening on the plane of the creature to be ensnared. A special saving throw is then made to determine if the creature detects the nature of the planar opening as a trap or believes it to be a gate. To save, the creature must roll equal to or less than its Intelligence score on 1d20. The score is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the creature has a higher score, the difference is subtracted from its dice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a higher score, the difference is added to the dice roll.<br />If the saving throw succeeds, the creature ignores the spell-created opening, and the spell fails. If the saving throw fails, the creature steps into the opening and is ensnared.<br />When so trapped, the otherplanar creature can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, unless the caster has created a warding circle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn by hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). Even with such protection, the entrapped creature may break free and wreak its vengeance upon the spellcaster.<br />A hand-drawn circle has a base failure chance of 20%, while one inlaid or carved has a base of 10% (and that is for the first time it is used, to determine whether or not the job was done properly). The base chance is modified by the difference between the wizard's combined Intelligence and experience level and the Intelligence and the experience level or Hit Dice of the creature ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher total, that difference in percentage points is subtracted from the chance for the creature to break free. If the creature has a higher total, that difference is added to its chance to break free.<br />The chance can be further reduced by careful preparation of the circle. If the hand-made circle is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments (1,000 gp value per turn spent drawing), the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every turn spent in preparation. This can bring the base chance to 0%.<br />Similarly, an inlaid or carved design can be brought to a 0% chance of the creature breaking free by inlaying with various metals, minerals, etc. This cost will require a minimum of one full month of time and add not less than 50,000 gp to the basic cost of having the circle inlaid or carved into stone. Any break in the circle spoils the efficacy of the spell and enables the creature to break free automatically. Even a straw dropped across the line of a magic circle destroys its power. Fortunately, the creature within cannot so much as place a straw upon any portion of the inscribed ward, for the magic of the barrier absolutely prevents it.<br />Once safely ensnared, the creature can be kept for as long as the spellcaster dares. (Remember the danger of something breaking the ward!) The creature cannot leave the circle, nor can any of its attacks or powers penetrate the barrier. The caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature.<br />The DM will then assign a value to what the wizard has said to the ensnared creature, rating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the Intelligence score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful Intelligence check against its adjusted Intelligence, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can be made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours later, when the creature's Intelligence has dropped by 1 point due to confinement. This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until the caster decides to get rid of it by means of some riddance spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.<br />Once the single service is completed, the creature need only so inform the spellcaster to be instantly sent from whence it came. The creature might<br />later seek revenge."

For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell's duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:<br />Charm: The wizard can charm a single person or monster by gaze and by uttering a single word. The effect is to make the charmed subject absolutely loyal and docile to the caster, even to the point of personal danger. It is otherwise the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses.<br />Fear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze and by speaking a single word. The subject flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds. After this, the creature refuses to face the caster and cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if subsequently confronted by the caster (50% chance of either). The latter effect lasts one turn per caster level. This attack can be negated by spells that counter fear.<br />Sicken: This power enables the caster to merely gaze, speak, a word, and cause sudden pain and fever to sweep over the subject's body. Creatures with ability scores function at half effectiveness; others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. Movement is at one-half normal rate. The subject remains stricken for one turn per level of the caster, after which all abilities return at the rate of one point per turn of complete rest or one point per hour of moderate activity. The effects cannot be negated by a cure disease or heal spell, but a remove curse or successful dispel magic spell is effective. Creatures other than humans, demihumans, and humanoids save with +2 bonuses versus this attack.<br />Sleep: The wizard can cause any individual to fall into a comatose slumber by means of a gaze and a single word, unless the subject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st-level sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An affected creature must be shaken or otherwise shocked back to consciousness.<br />In all cases, the gaze attack has a speed factor of 1. This spell does not affect undead of any type, or extend beyond the plane occupied by the caster. Note that the caster is subject to the effects of his reflected gaze and is allowed any applicable saving throw. In the case of a reflected charm gaze, the caster is paralyzed until it wears off or is countered."

If placed in an open corridor or archway to prevent passage, the greater sign creates a magical barrier that repels all who try to pass.<br />Second, the greater sign greatly strengthens the physical structure of any door or item it is placed upon, granting a +6 bonus on any item saving throws and allowing the item or door to ignore 1 point of damage per caster level from any attack. For example, a greater sign cast by a 12th-level wizard would reduce the damage of any blow or spell by 12 points, so a fighter armed with a broad sword (maximum damage of 8 points) could never hack through a door protected by the sign. Finally, if the protected doorway or item is forced open or destroyed by any means, the sign itself is not only destroyed, but also releases a spell upon the offending creature. The spell held by the sign is cast into the ward when the greater sign is created, and any spell the caster has memorized may be used in this way, from a fireball or shocking grasp to a very nasty wish or polymorph. The range of the sign’s retributive spell is 10 yards per caster level, so it is possible to destroy the warding from a safe distance.<br />The sign is displayed in plain sight, and most wizards will recognize it for what it is. The caster cannot specify particular creatures or conditions for the sign’s operation; it functions against any creature that attempts to pass it, although the wizard can freely pass through his own sign without activating it. The greater sign can be removed by the caster, thus ending the spell, or it can be defeated by a limited wish or wish spell cast by a wizard of equal or higher level than the original caster; it cannot be dispelled.<br />The material component for a greater sign is a powdered diamond worth at least 1,000 gold pieces."

The wizard can ward a multistory area by reducing the base area proportionately. The following take place in the warded area upon casting the spell:<br />1. All corridors become misty; visibility is reduced to 10 feet.<br />2. All doors are wizard locked.<br />3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to bottom. These act as the 2nd-level web spell, except that they regrow within one turn if destroyed.<br />4. Where there are choices in direction--such as a cross or side passage--a minor confusion-type spell functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the exact opposite direction.<br />5. The whole area radiates magic. The normal use of the detect magic spell becomes impossible for those of less than the caster's level and difficult for others.<br />6. One door per level of experience of the wizard is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall.<br />7. The wizard can place one of the following additional magical effects:<br />A. Dancing lights in four corridors.<br />B. A magic mouth in two places.<br />C. A stinking cloud in two places.<br />D. A gust of wind in one corridor or room.<br />E. A suggestion in one place.<br />Note that items 6 and 7 function only when the wizard is totally familiar with the area of the spell's effect. Dispel magic can remove one effect, at random, per casting. A remove curse spell will not work.<br />The material components of the spell are burning incense, a small measure of sulphur and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod."

If only detailed information on the person, place, or thing is known, casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors are known, casting time is 2d6 weeks.<br />During the casting, the wizard cannot engage in activities other than the routine: eating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the divination reveals if legendary material is available. It often reveals where this material is--by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It sometimes gives certain information regarding the person, place, or thing (when the object of the legend lore is at hand), but this data is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, riddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). Naturally, a legend lore spell reveals information only if the person, place, or thing is noteworthy or legendary.<br />For example, suppose Delsenora came across an extremely well-made sword. It radiates magic, but when she used an identify spell, she could not learn any information. Even giving it to a trusted fighter didn't work, as the sword did not reveal any special powers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, hoping to gain more information. Since the sword is at hand, she completes the spell in three turns. In her mind comes the message, \"Once this was the sword of he who waits till Albion's time of greatest peril, when unto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the hand that gave me and fair was the hand that reclaimed me.\" Clearly, Delsenora realizes, this must be a very powerful item, since her spell gave only a cryptic answer. But who is he who waits? And where is Albion? For more information, Delsenora is going to have to cast more spells. But now the process will take much longer, since she has only the vaguest of clues to follow.<br />The legend lore spell is cast with incense and strips of ivory formed into a rectangle, but some item of value to the caster must be sacrificed in addition--a potion, magical scroll, magical item, etc."

Even after this, the spell persists for a total of one hour plus one additional turn for each experience level of the caster. (Note: Minimal concentration can be maintained during normal conversation but not while spellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an attack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit of anything connected with the place to create this spell, it takes on a quasi reality.<br />In its basic form, forceful contact is necessary to have any hope of discovering the magic, short of a detection device or spell. In its more complex form, where a material component is used, detection is possible only by some magical means, whether device, item, or spell. Either form of mirage arcana is subject to the dispel magic spell.<br />As with all powerful illusions, the mind of the believer urges appropriate effects upon the viewer's body. Under the influence of the spell, the viewer could possibly walk across a bed of hot coals thinking it was a shallow stream of water that was cooling his feet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon imaginary food and actually be satisfied, or rest comfortably upon a bed of sharp stones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is not affected by the spell, however, so an envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm does not support the believer.

The maximum area that can be affected is 240 yards x 240 yards, which takes four hours.<br />If terrain features are to be moved--as compared to simply caving in banks or walls of earth--it is necessary that an earth elemental be subsequently summoned to assist. All spell casting or summoning must be completed before any effects occur. As any summoned earth elemental will perform most of its work underground, it is unlikely that it will be intercepted or interrupted. Should this occur, however, the movement of the earth requiring its services must be stopped until the elemental is once again available. Should the elemental be slain or dismissed, the move earth spell is limited to collapsing banks or walls of earth.<br />The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures; its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.<br />The material components for this spell are a mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a small bag and an iron blade. Note: This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved.

A saving throw vs. spell is applicable; all damage is negated if it is successful (as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed).

This creates a small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, but not harmful. This globe can be hurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 yards (considered short range), or as a sling bullet. The globe shatters upon impact, inflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10-foot radius (one-half damage if a saving throw vs. spell is successful).

			"body": "When this spell is cast, the wizard designates one inanimate object of stone, earth, or metal within the spell’s range to function as a powerful magnet, attracting all metal. The object affected can be no larger than a 10-foot cube, although a section of wall, floor, or ceiling about 10 square feet will work. Once magnetized, the object exerts a powerful attractive or repulsive force (caster’s choice) against objects of ferrous metal. The effects vary by the proximity of the metal objects to the center of magnetism, as shown below:<br /><table><tr><th>Distance to Magnetism</th><th>Movement Rate per Round</th><th>Effective Strength</th><th>Missile Attack Penalty</th></tr><tr><td>10 feet or less</td><td>40 feet</td><td>22 (Garg.)</td><td>–40</td></tr><tr><td>20 feet or less</td><td>20 feet</td><td>20 (Huge)</td><td>–20</td></tr><tr><td>30 feet or less</td><td>10 feet</td><td>18 (Large)</td><td>–10</td></tr><tr><td>40 feet or less</td><td>5 feet</td><td>14 (Medium)</td><td>–5</td></tr><tr><td>50 feet or less</td><td>2 feet</td><td>10 (Small)</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>60 feet or less</td><td>1 foot</td><td>4 (Tiny)</td><td>–1</td></tr></table><br />The movement rate represents how fast objects are drawn to or repelled from the center of magnetism. If the creature or object in question is heavier than the magnetized item, the magnetized item does the moving instead. The effective Strength is the «pull» of the magnetism at that range; the size equivalent refers to creature sizes, not weapon sizes. (All human-sized weapons are considered small or tiny for this chart). A character or creature carrying loose metal items or objects such as weapons, shields, helms, buttons, and so on must win an opposed Strength check (see Player’s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics for information on opposed ability checks) in order to keep his possessions from being wrenched out of his grasp by the magnetism. Securing a weapon in its sheath, holding an item with both hands, and other precautions may give the character a +2 to +4 to his base ability score, at the DM’s discretion.<br />Characters wearing metal armor must attempt an opposed Strength check to ignore the effects of the magnetism. If the character fails his Strength check outright, he loses his footing and flies towards or away from the object at the full rate indicated. He suffers full falling damage based on the speed with which he hits the item—1d6 for every 10 feet of the movement rate, or half that damage if he is repelled and simply thrown back onto the ground. If the character passes his Strength check but is beaten by the magnetism roll, he is moved one foot for each point he lost by. Again, some precautions or assistance may help iron-wearing characters in their Strength checks. For monsters, compare the creature’s size to the effective size of magnetism.<br />An armored character who is stuck to a surface or object loses any Dexterity adjustments to AC and cannot make any physical attacks. He can try to wriggle out of his armor and free himself, employ a magical item, or use psionic powers if he has any at his disposal.<br />Lodestone the fighter is charging a wizard when the dastardly felon magnetizes a sizable boulder about 30 feet from Lodestone’s present position. Lodestone carries a long sword, a shield, and wears plate mail; he has a Strength of 17. First, he checks to see if he holds onto his sword and shield, making two opposed Strength rolls. He loses the shield, but keeps hold of his sword. Now the DM checks to see if Lodestone resists the drag on his armor. At 30 feet, the magnetism has a Strength of 18. Lodestone rolls a 6, but the magnetism roll is a 12. Even though both Lodestone and the magnetism made their Strength rolls, the magnetism roll is higher than Lodestone’s roll and does not go over its target Strength score. As a result, Lodestone is dragged 6 feet closer to it. Next round, Lodestone tries again and blows his roll altogether, moving a full 10 feet closer. Now only 14 feet from the boulder, the magnetism’s Strength is effectively a 20, which means Lodestone is in big trouble. If he blows his roll again the next round, he’ll go flying into the boulder at a rate of 20 feet/round, which will inflict 2d6 points of damage.<br />If a creature wins its Strength check, it can ignore the spell’s effects and move out of the zone of influence normally.<br />Sirellyn’s superior magnetism also affects the passage of iron or steel missiles, such as steel-headed arrows or quarrels. Any missile that passes through the zone of influence suffers an attack penalty equal to the movement at the range indicated. For example, if the path of an arrow brings it within 40 feet of a magnetized object, the attack suffers a –5 penalty. Finally, it is possible for the casting wizard to be affected by this spell as well. As a result, the wizard had better make sure that he’s out of the effective area of effect when casting.<br />The material component for this spell is a small bar magnet, bent into a U-shape and coated with mithral."

The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained; once these points are eliminated, all subsequent damage (to his true hit points) is doubled. The Armor Class of the wizard is 4 better than that possessed prior to casting the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 to 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor Class of -10.<br />All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e., the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters). The wizard can use either a dagger or a staff when attacking. A dagger can be used twice per round, and each successful attack inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A staff can be used only once per round, but with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. The wizard fights in melee in preference to all other forms of attack, and continues attacking until all opponents are slain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or the spell duration expires.<br />The material component for casting this spell is a potion of heroism (or superheroism) that the wizard must consume during the course of uttering the spell."

One tentacle grows on each side of the caster's body, centered between his armpit and his thigh. The caster can use the tentacles as normal appendages to grasp tools, use weapons, or help with climbing.<br />Each tentacle can make an attack, effectively giving the caster two extra attacks per round; a tentacle can strike to inflict 1-6 hit points of damage, or it can wield a sword, dagger, or other weapon (at the same ability of the caster). The flexible tentacles can easily reach victims on any side of the caster's body.<br />If an unarmed tentacle makes a successful strike against a victim who is man-sized or smaller (less than 7 feet tall), it also grabs and holds the victim to inflict an automatic 2-8 (2d4) hit points of damage in every subsequent round. To free himself, the victim must sever the tentacle; there is no way to loosen the grip other than severing the member, killing the caster, or negating the spell with dispel magic. A tentacle is severed if it takes 10 hit points of damage; damage directed at the tentacle has no adverse effects on the caster.<br />A caster with two intact tentacles adds a 40 percent bonus modifier to his climbing success rate (see page 122 of the Player's Handbook, ) and adds a 20 percent modifier if he has only one intact tentacle.<br />The material component for this spell is a dried tentacle from a small octopus"

These points are not expended until the wizard is psionically attacked. The tower of mental mistance remains in force until its strength is exhausted, to a maximum of 24 hours. Casting another such spell restores a partially depleted tower to full strength (reroll PSPs), and extends the maximum duration to 24 hours from the time of the casting.<br/>When the wizard is attacked psionically, the tower of mental resistance instantly becomes active (attempting any telepathic science or devotion against the wizard counts as an attack). Each round that the wizard is attacked, the tower expends 6 PSPs. When the tower runs out of PSPs, the protection fails. The caster can end the spell at any time by an act of will.

He also gains a troll’s ability to ignore dismemberment, decapitation, and other horrible injuries that would normally incapacitate or kill him outright (although losing a limb may prevent the caster from taking certain actions, such as running, climbing, and other activities). Bleeding, wounding, being reduced to negative hit points, and other effects that cause the victim to lose hit points from round to round are ignored—the caster instead regains 3 hit points per round, up to his normal maximum. If the caster is reduced to less than 0 hit points, he is incapacitated and must make a system shock roll or lose all of his highest level spells. The incapacitation lasts only until his regeneration restores him to 1 hit point or more; he can move, fight, and cast spells again as soon as his hit point total is positive.<br />Trollish fortitude does not provide the caster with any defenses against lethal poison, disease, and other effects that don’t cause a loss of hit points. Hit points lost through level draining, vampiric touch, or vampiric regeneration cannot be regenerated since this represents damage to the victim’s life force, and not physical injury. In addition, fire damage and acid damage cannot be regenerated. While the spell is in effect, the caster can rejoin severed limbs simply by holding them in place, but if the spell ends while a limb (which were already moving toward him) is still separate from his body, he immediately suffers the full effects of the injury.<br />The material component for this spell is a shred of dried flesh from a troll’s heart that must be pulverized into dust.

If the undead creature has intelligence, it is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to resist the joining. If the save is successful, the caster's spirit is forced back into his own body. The wizard must make a system shock roll; if the roll fails, the wizard suffers 5d6 points of damage. If the roll succeeds, the wizard suffers half this damage.<br />If the creature's save fails, the necromancer joins his life essence with that of the undead. While in the creature's body, the caster can use all of its special attacks and innate abilities, excluding spells memorized by the creature.<br />The wizard's body remains comatose, is subject to all regular attacks, and suffers damage normally. The wizard's spirit can travel an unlimited distance from his physical body as long as they remain on the same plane of existence.<br />If intelligent, the possessed undead continually tries to purge the caster with mental threats that can be heard only by the wizard. The thoughts of the undead are ghastly. During the first minute of each hour of possession, the caster must succeed an Intelligence check in order to retain his sanity. The roll is modified by the difference between the creature's Intelligence and that of the spellcaster. If the undead has a higher score, the difference is added to the die roll. If the necromancer has a higher Intelligence, the difference is subtracted from the roll.<br />If the roll is successful, nothing happens and the caster may continue to possess the undead. If the Intelligence roll fails, the wizard's intellect degenerates, making him a raving, homicidal maniac. His spirit is immediately forced to return to his body, and he must attempt a system shock roll with damage occurring as outlined above. The caster remains dangerously insane until a heal or wish spell is used to restore his intellect.<br />This spell can be very useful when combined with the mask of death spell.<br />When the spell's duration expires, the necromancer's spirit immediately returns to his body."

Creatures are entitled to a normal saving throw vs. spell to withstand the spell.

The caster has no idea what kind of madness the spell inflicts on its victim, although he may be able to form an educated guess after observing the victim for a few rounds. Descent into madness accelerates the process of insanity radically, producing an advanced condition almost immediately; for example, a character rendered paranoid by this spell skips past suspicion and instantly regards his friends and allies as enemies of the worst sort. The victim has a small chance of recovering with the passage of time (as described under each type of insanity) but other than that the only ways to repair the effects of this spell are restoration, wish, or use of the psionic power psychic surgery.<br />The material component is a special cube of gold wire worth at least 500 gold pieces shaped to represent a tesseract, or four-dimensional<br />figure."

The single object can be no longer in any dimension than a sword, can have no more weight than a shield (about eight pounds), and must be nonliving.<br />To prepare this spell, the wizard must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp value in his hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. At some point in the future, he must crush the gem and utter the final word. The desired item is then transported instantly into the spellcaster's right or left hand, as he desires.<br />The item must have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named; only that particular item is summoned by the spell. During the initial incantation, the gem becomes magically inscribed with the name of the item to be summoned. The inscription is invisible and unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to all but the wizard who cast the summons.<br />If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, and the caster knows who the possessor is and roughly where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence, but only if such items are not in the possession (not necessarily the physical grasp) of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th, the wizard is able to summon a desired item from one plane farther removed from the plane he is in at the time the spell is cast (one plane away at 14th level, two planes away at 15th, etc.). Thus, a wizard of 16th level could cast the spell even if the desired item was on the second layer of one of the Outer Planes, but at 14th level the wizard would be able to summon the item only if it were no farther than one of the Inner Planes, the Ethereal Plane, or the Astral Plane (see the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set). Note that special wards or barriers, or factors that block the teleport or plane shift spells, may also block the operation of this spell. Objects in Leomund's secret chest cannot be recovered by using this spell.<br />Note: If the item is wizard marked, it can be summoned from anywhere on the same plane unless special local conditions apply. Furthermore, the details of the location of the item are more specific, and the item is more easily traceable with other types of scrying magic."

The wizard can perform all actions normally. He can turn and become invisible, move in this state, and appear again next round and cast a spell, disappearing on the following round.<br />Note that when turned, the wizard cannot be affected by any form of attack, but when visible, he is subject to double the amount of damage normal for an attack form; for example, a dagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of damage if it struck a duo-dimensional wizard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion of his existence in the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect, and he is subject to possible notice by creatures there. If noticed, it is 25% probable that the wizard is pulled entirely into the Astral Plane by any attack from an astral creature. Such an attack (and any subsequent attack received on the Astral Plane) inflicts normal damage.<br />The material components of this spell are a flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which must be of finest workmanship, gold filigreed, and enameled and gem-studded at an average cost of 500 to 1,000 gp) and a strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered, the parchment is given half a twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop, and both disappear forever."

The changes can be reversed before animation by a limited wish or similar spell cast directly upon the body, and a full wish restores the subject to life.<br />The caster utters the finger of death spell incantation, points his index finger at the creature to be slain, and unless the victim succeeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death occurs.

Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings--and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.<br />A creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check does not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spell or by the expiration of the spell.<br />By means of special preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to a forcecube spell. The cube created is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power.<br />Although the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and it will disappear."

It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage, increase duration of some magical effect, cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th level or less, and so on (see the 9th-level wish spell). Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.

Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they behold a magnificent foyer and numerous chambers beyond.

There is a staff of near-transparent servants, liveried and obedient, to wait upon all who enter.

			"body": "Related to both the contingency and permanency spells, persistence allows a wizard to cast a spell of 6th level or lower and then hold it until it is needed. There are two general uses for persistence: to use a personal spell effect as needed up to the maximum duration of the persistence itself, or to prepare an instantaneous spell and hold it ready until the caster wishes to use it.<br />A. Personal effect. Any spell that augments the wizard’s natural abilities—detect magic, protection from evil, jump, infravision, fly, wraithform, or other caster-affecting spells—can be made persistent by use of this spell. The wizard casts persistence and then immediately follows with the desired spell. Instead of taking effect immediately, the magic of the persistence holds it ready for use by a simple act of will. The wizard can then «turn on» or «turn off» the girded spell as often as he likes over the course of the duration of the persistence. The duration of the girded spell only runs while the spell is active, so a 15th-level wizard who makes a fly spell persistent will be able to use 1d6+15 turns of flight (the normal duration of fly) over the next 15 days (the duration of the persistence) as he sees fit. This is especially useful because it allows the wizard to cast the girded spell and the persistence and have the girded spell’s effects available while he then memorizes another spell in place of the spell made persistent. It is also useful because the girded spell can be activated instantly by an act of will. The main difference between this spell and contingency lies in the fact that a persistent spell may be invoked several times (up to the limit of its normal duration) while a contingency functions once only.<br />B. Held spell. Spells that have an instantaneous effect, such as most attack spells and some movement spells like teleport or dimension door, can be rendered persistent as well. The held spell may be activated or discharged at any time during the duration of the persistence, but its magic is then exhausted as if it had been cast normally. This resembles the effect of a contingency spell, but the effect has no predefined conditions and simply occurs when the caster wills it to. Damaging or offensive spells that have a duration (for example, flaming sphere or wall of fire) cannot be rendered persistent. A wizard may have no more than one persistence spell active at any given time; if he girds a new spell while an old one is still persistent, the old spell is simply replaced by the new one. The material component is a crystal chalice of exquisite workmanship worth at least 2,000 gp. The material component of a held or girded spell is expended when the spell is made persistent."

The phase door is invisible to all creatures save the spellcaster, and only he can use the space or passage the spell creates, disappearing when the phase door is entered, and appearing when it is exited. If the caster desires, one other creature of man size or less can be taken through the door; this counts as two uses of the door. The door does not pass light, sound, or spell effects, nor can the caster see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing and similar magic will reveal the presence of a phase door but will not allow its use.<br />The phase door lasts for one usage for every two levels of experience of the spellcaster. It can be dispelled only by a casting of dispel magic from a higher-level wizard, or from several lower-level wizards, casting in concert, whose combined levels of experience are more than double that of the wizard who cast the spell (this is the only instance in which dispel effects can be combined).<br />Rumor has it that this spell has been adapted by a certain powerful wizard (or wizards) to create renewable (or permanent) portals, which may (or may not) be keyed to specific individuals (henchmen) or items (such as rings)."

In addition, as long as at least one eye is still in existence, the caster gains 360° vision and can detect invisibility and detect phase at will, with a 60-foot range. The powers of each eye are described below.<br />Eye of the Mind. This orb protects the caster against mental attack, charm, or influence, including charm, beguiling, hold, and emotion effects. The first such attack is negated by the orb and destroys it in turn. If the wizard desires, the eye of the mind can instead be used to charm person like the 1st-level wizard spell, although this also expends the orb.<br />Eye of the Sword. This eye deflects the first physical attack that endangers the caster, including hand-held or missile attacks, and then disappears. The wizard can also employ the eye of the sword to create five magical blades that strike as magic missiles for 1d4+1 points of damage each. (Knockdown d6, medium (1 hit) impact)<br />Eye of the Mage. One manifestation of raw energy, such as lightning, fire, force, cold, or a similar effect, is absorbed by the eye of the mage. The eye can also project a 60-foot long by 5-foot wide lightning bolt that inflicts 4d8 damage (saving throw vs. spell for half damage) to all in its path. Either use expends the eye’s power. (Knockdown d12, large (1–3 hits) electricity)<br />Eye of Venom. This eye can be used to halt any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. In the case of an attacker armed with an envenomed weapon, the caster may decide to expend either the eye of venom or the eye of swords in order to block the attack. The eye can also be used to poison one creature within 30 feet; the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in one round.<br />Eye of the Spirit. The first attack that affects the victim’s life energy, including energy drain, strength drain, cause wounds, trap the soul, magic jar, or death is parried by the eye of the spirit. The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye’s power by casting enervation (see the 4th-level wizard spell) upon one target within 30 feet.<br />Eye of Artifice. This eye deflects and is destroyed by the first attack directed at the caster from a magical device. If the attack also takes a form that may be blocked by another eye (for example, the bolt from a wand of lightning) the caster may choose which eye is expended. If used to attack instead, the eye of artifice functions as a dispel magic cast at 8th level.<br />Eye of Stone. This eye offers protection against the first attack that could petrify the caster and then vanishes. It can also be expended to cast hold person.<br />Although any number of eyes can defend the wizard in the course of a single round, only one eye may be used to attack per round. When the caster uses an eye to attack, he may not cast a spell, attack physically, or employ another magical item in the same round; willing the eye to discharge its energies requires his complete concentration. Eye attacks are considered to have an initiative modifier of 1 or a speed of very fast in the Player’s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics initiative system.<br />The material component is seven blessed gemstones worth at least 50 gold pieces each."

The desire to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. Unless a saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled, the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object.

The components vary according to the form of the spell, but they include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or book page giving the spell; gestures appropriate to the form of binding; and materials such as miniature chains of special metal (silver for lycanthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest sort, a corundum or diamond gem of great size (1,000 gp value per Hit Die of the subject creature), and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.<br />Magic resistance applies unless the subject's true name is used. A saving throw is not applicable as long as the experience level of the caster is at least twice as great as the Hit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can be augmented by one-third of the levels of each assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, and by one level for each assistant of 4th through 8th level. No more than six other wizards can assist with this spell. If the caster's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the subject, the subject gains a saving throw vs. spell, modified by the form of binding being attempted. The various forms of binding are:<br />Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except the caster. Duration is as long as one year per level of the caster(s). The subject of this form of binding (as well as in the slumber and bound slumber versions) remains within the restraining barrier.<br />Slumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon the subject for a duration of up to one year per level of the caster(s).<br />Bound Slumber: A combination of chaining and slumber that lasts for up to one month per level of the caster(s).<br />Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means until freed.<br />The spell remains until the magical hedge is somehow broken. Metamorphosis: Causes the subject to change to some noncorporeal form, save for its head or face. The binding is permanent until some prescribed act frees the subject. Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunken to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within the hedged prison of some gem or similar object. The subject of a minimus containment, metamorphosis, or hedged prison radiates a very faint aura of magic.<br />The subject of the chaining form of the spell receives a saving throw with no modifications. However, slumber allows the subject a +1 bonus, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged prison a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 bonus, and minimus containment a +5 bonus to the saving throw. If the subject is magically weakened, the DM can assign a -1, -2, or even -4 penalty to the saving throw. A successful saving throw enables the subject to burst its bonds and do as it pleases.<br />A binding spell can be renewed in the case of the first three forms of the spell, for the subject does not have the opportunity to break the bonds. (If anything has caused a weakening of a chaining or slumber version, such as attempts to contact the subject or magically touch it, a normal saving throw applies to the renewal of the spell.) Otherwise, after one year, and each year thereafter, the subject gains a normal saving throw vs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the binding spell is broken and the creature is free."

As long as the heart of stone remains in effect, the caster need not fear attacks that pierce, slash, or cut him; he does not bleed and can ignore the most horrible injuries of this kind. The caster can also ignore most magical effects such as spells, magical devices, and innate spell abilities of less than 8th level.<br />In game terms, the character suffers only 1 point of damage from any type S or type P attack, plus any magical adjustment for the weapon. For example, if struck by a long sword +1, he would suffer only 2 points of damage. Strength and specialization bonuses are ignored. If the wizard is dismembered, he suffers no additional damage other than the inconvenience of having his limbs removed, and he can reattach a severed limb by holding it in place for one full turn. The heart of stone is also partially effective against type B attacks since it prevents bruising, swelling, and crushed blood vessels. Against bludgeoning weapons, the wizard only suffers half the normal damage. Cause wound spells always inflict minimum damage against a wizard protected by this spell. While the caster may not feel a sword in his rib cage, any damage sustained interrupts spellcasting.<br />In addition to resisting injury, the heart of stone also renders the character immune to fatigue and exhaustion, whether normal or magical. He also gains a +4 bonus to saving throws vs. petrification attacks.<br />While the heart of stone is quite powerful, it has limitations. First of all, determined physical attack can eventually destroy the wizard despite his unnatural resistance to injury—a mob of angry peasants with hatchets and spears can finish him off 1 point at a time if that’s what it takes. Second, the heart confers no protection against other attack forms, such as fire, electricity, cold, acid, and so on, although any bleeding caused by a burn is ignored. Disintegration effects also affect the caster. Most importantly, the caster loses the ability to naturally recover from injury and no longer regains lost hit points with the passage of time. Healing spells, potions and items are reduced to their minimum effect, so a cure serious wounds (2d8+1 hit points restored) would only return 3 hit points to a wizard protected by heart of stone. However, limited wish or wish can be used to restore 1 hit point per level of caster or all but 1d4 hit points, respectively.<br />In addition to these disadvantages, heart of stone also renders the caster vulnerable in one other way: his own real heart can be destroyed, instantly slaying him. Naturally, the caster will want to take steps to hide and protect his true heart to prevent this from happening. The living heart continues to beat for the duration of the spell but requires no special receptacle or facilities to protect it—the caster could leave it lying on the floor, if he wished.<br />The heart of stone cannot be dispelled, although a more powerful negation magic such as Mordenkainen’s disjunction can bring the spell to an end. Stone to flesh also undoes the magic of the heart of stone. No matter how the spell is ended, the wizard’s own living heart instantly returns to its proper place, and the stone heart appears wherever the living heart was kept. At this time, any injuries the wizard currently has are multiplied by 1d6 as the wounds begin to bleed again. For example, a necromancer who was injured for 6 points of damage instead suffers 6d6 when the spell ends.<br />The material component for this spell is the stone heart itself. This must be a carved stone of quality (jade, obsidian, or gold-veined marble would be appropriate) worth not less than 5,000 gold pieces. It must be prepared by use of the enchant an item spell. The stone is not consumed at the spell’s end and may be used again if it is undamaged."

The homunculus has the attributes and saving throws of the wizard.<br />At the end of the spell's duration, the homunculus disappears and any hit points it had are restored to the wizard. Hit points lost by the homunculus can be regained only by magical healing. If the wizard's hit points are reduced to zero at any time during the spell, the wizard is dead even if the homunculus had hit points remaining. A wizard with an active homunculus shield suffers a -4 saving throw penalty against magic jar spells cast upon him due to the division of his mental energy.

			"body": "This spell transforms the caster’s body into living iron, which grants him several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster can only be injured by blunt weapons of +3 or better value, or monsters of 8+3 Hit Dice or more. Slashing weapons, falling, crushing, and constriction attacks of all types are completely unable to harm the caster, although an attack may knock him off-balance or pin him beneath tons of debris. Spells or attacks that affect the subject’s physiology or respiration—for example, poison, cloudkill, enfeeblement, contagion, or pain touch—fail completely, since the caster has no physiology or respiration while the spell is in effect. Also, spells that have weight limits should be applied to the wizard as if he weighed over 3,000 pounds. The wizard ignores electrical attacks and saves at +4 against fire attacks. If he saves, he takes quarter damage; if not, he takes half damage. If hit with a rod of smiting, he takes 2d8+6 points of damage unless the attacker rolls a natural 20. If this occurs, then the damage is doubled.<br />In addition to the natural immunities of an iron body, the wizard enjoys powerful offensive abilities. His Strength score is raised to 20 (+3 to attack rolls, +8 damage) for the duration of the spell, and he can punch or bludgeon his enemies twice per round for 1d4 points of damage per blow, plus his Strength bonus. Unfortunately, his movement becomes slow and awkward, so he is reduced to a move of 3 and suffers a –2 penalty to his initiative rolls (or a reduction of his base phase by one step, in Player’s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics). Most importantly, the wizard’s clumsiness and lack of breath prevent him from casting any spells while the iron body is in effect.<br />Iron body may create additional hazards for the wizard as the DM deems appropriate. For example, rust monsters are extremely dangerous to a wizard using this spell. Heat metal spells inflict double damage to the caster. And, naturally, the wizard sinks like a stone in water—although he could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell expired. Some magical items, such as potions or winded instruments, may be temporarily unusable as well.<br />The material component for this spell is a small piece of iron that once belonged to an iron golem."

Each permanency spell lowers the wizard's Constitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot cast these spells upon other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a wizard of greater level than the spellcaster was when he cast the spell.<br />In addition to personal use, the permanency spell can be used to make the following object/creature or area-effect spells permanent:<br />enlarge<br />prismatic sphere<br />fear<br />stinking cloud<br />gust of wind<br />wall of fire<br />invisibility<br />wall of force<br />magic mouth<br />web<br />Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent:<br />alarm<br />wall of fire<br />audible glamer<br />distance distortion<br />dancing lights<br />teleport<br />solid fog<br />These applications to other spells allow it to be cast simultaneously with any of the latter when no living creature is the target, but the entire spell complex then can be dispelled normally, and thus negated.<br />The permanency spell is also used in the fabrication of magical items (see the 6th-level spell enchant an item). At the DM's option, permanency might become unstable or fail after a long period of at least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently or fail altogether.<br />The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell.

When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the spell as a more powerful version, with saving throws made with -4 penalties to the die roll. When it is cast in order to change other objects, the duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state, as well as how different it is in size. The DM determines the changes by using the following guidelines:<br /><table><tr><th>Kingdom</th><td>Animal, vegetable, mineral</td></tr><tr><th>Class</th><td>Mammals, bipeds, fungi, metals, etc.</td></tr><tr><th>Relationship</th><td>Twig is to tree, sand is to beach, etc.</td></tr><tr><th>Size</th><td>Smaller, equal, larger</td></tr><tr><th>Shape</th><td>Comparative resemblance of the original to the polymorphed state</td></tr><tr><th>Intelligence</th><td>Particularly with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent</td></tr></table><br />A change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours (if removed by one kingdom) or turns (if removed by two). Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus, changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent, but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be a change with a duration measured in hours. Turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent, but turning a twig into a sword would be a change with a duration of several turns.<br />All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic, and if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon them, they return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh spell or its reverse will affect objects under this spell. As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature.<br />For example, it is possible to polymorph a creature into rock and grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed; perhaps the wizard could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is altered through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate many of these situations.<br />The system shock roll must be applied to living creatures, as must the restrictions noted regarding the polymorph other and stone to flesh spells. Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an item's or creature's powers, but does not add new powers, except possibly movement capabilities not present in the old form. Thus, a vorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger would not retain vorpal capability. Likewise, valueless items cannot be made into permanent valuable items.<br />The material components of this spell are mercury, gum arabic, and smoke."

(Note: \"magical properties\" include those of magical items as listed in the Dungeon Master Guide, those of items enchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and those of items with protection-type spells or with permanent magical properties or similar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical nature are not entitled to a saving throw. If a subject fails its saving throw, it becomes of slightly greater density than the surface upon which it stands.<br />The spellcaster now has the option of ceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it is, in which case the spell expires in four turns, and the subject returns to normal. If the caster proceeds with the spell (into the next round), the subject begins to sink slowly into the ground. Before any actions are taken in the new round, the subject sinks one-quarter of its height; after the first group acts, another quarter; after the second group acts, another; and at the end of the round, the victim is totally sunken into the ground.<br />This entombment places a creature or object in a state of suspended animation. The cessation of time means that the subject does not grow older. Bodily and other functions virtually cease, but the subject is otherwise unharmed. The subject exists in undamaged form in the surface into which it was sunk, its upper point as far beneath the surface as the subject has height--a 6-foot-tall victim will be 6 feet beneath the surface, while a 60-foottall subject will have its uppermost point 60 feet below ground level. If the ground around the subject is somehow removed, the spell is broken and the subject returns to normal, but it does not rise up. Spells such as dig, transmute rock to mud, and freedom (the reverse of the 9th-level spell imprisonment) will not harm the sunken creature or object and will often be helpful in recovering it. If a detect magic spell is cast over an area upon which a sink spell was used, it reveals a faint magical aura of undefinable nature, even if the subject is beyond detection range. If the subject is within range of the detection, the spell's schools can be discovered (alteration and enchantment)."

The bickering lasts for 5d4 rounds, the fighting for 2d4 rounds.<br />• Fear: This symbol creates an extra-strong fear spell, causing all creatures to save vs. spell with -4 penalties to the die roll, or panic and flee as if attacked by a fear spell.<br />• Hopelessness: All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save vs. spell. Affected creatures submit to the demands of any opponent--for example, surrender, get out, etc. The hopelessness lasts for 3d4 turns; during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures take no action during any round, and 25% likely that those taking action turn back or retire from battle, as applicable.<br />• Insanity: One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 become insane and remain so, acting as if a confusion spell had been placed upon them, until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove the madness.<br />• Pain: All creatures are afflicted with wracking pains shooting through their bodies, causing a -2 penalty to Dexterity and a -4 penalty to attack rolls for 2d10 turns.<br />• Sleep: All creatures under 8+1 Hit Dice immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 1d12+4 turns.<br />• Stunning: One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 are stunned and reeling for 3d4 rounds, dropping anything they are holding.<br />The type of symbol cannot be recognized without being read and thus activating its effects. The material components of this spell are powdered black opal and diamond dust, worth not less than 5,000 gp each."

The creature must be seen by the caster when the final word is uttered. The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. First, the final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range. This allows magic resistance (if any) and a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the creature's real name is spoken as well, any magic resistance is ignored and the saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty of -2. If the saving throw is successful, the prison gem shatters.<br />The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's true name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger item when the gem is enchanted. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem, without the benefit of magic resistance or saving throw.<br />The gem prison will hold the trapped entity indefinitely, or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.<br />Before the actual casting of the trap the soul spell, the wizard must prepare the prison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die or level of experience possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 Hit Die or 10th-level creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (Note that while characters have no concept of level as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as characters advance.) Creating the prison gem requires an enchant an item spell and the placement of a maze spell into the gem, thereby forming the prison to contain the life force."

Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane (although nonmagical items could be rendered temporarily magical through the use of some spells, if the DM allows). As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane.<br />At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially; however, normally only a psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed in a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation.<br />Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the wizard desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (such as a dispel magic spell or the destruction of the wizard's body in the Prime Material Plane).<br />The wizard can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with him by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the wizard. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the wizard and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast, according to the wizard's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the wizard. (See the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set for further information on the Astral Plane.)<br />Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Armor and weapons of +3 or better might function in other planes, at the DM's option. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane (for example, a ring of fire resistance in the Elemental Plane of Fire or a sword of life stealing in the Negative Energy plane)."

The hand is susceptible to normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but if it is struck by an area-effect spell, the person held suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if the hand fails its saving throw, the victim automatically fails his). The hand is not effective against noncorporeal or gaseous forms, but it does prevent creatures that are able to slip through small cracks from escaping. If the hand grasps an item or construction, the appropriate saving throw must be made as if squeezed by a Strength of 25.<br />The material components of the spell are a glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg."

In other words, when a set of conditions is met, the designated spells are \"cast\" immediately without the caster's intervention.<br />Chain contingency must be cast together with the spells it is to trigger. The caster may choose either two spells to occur simultaneously or three spells to occur consecutively, one per round. Spells must be of 8th level or lower. Only the 6th-level contingency spell may not be included. The casting time of 2 turns includes the casting of the spells to be triggered.<br />Unlike the contingency spell, spells \"stored\" in chain contingency can affect creatures other than the caster. These instructions must be carefully worded; the spell obeys the letter of its instructions and not the caster's intentions.<br />In casting chain contingency, the wizard defines the conditions that will trigger the \"stored\" spells. This definition must be carefully worded, but may be as limiting or general as the caster desires. The caster also states the exact order, target, range, and manner in which the stored spells are to be cast.<br />The spell has several limitations in triggering its spells. It does not have any powers of discernment; thus, an instruction to \"target the highestlevel enemy\" is not possible. Furthermore, the conditions cannot involve a delay; a spell cannot be ordered to trigger \"three turns after I sneeze.\"<br />When the named conditions are met, the chain contingency is automatically triggered. If all specifics of casting a spell are not specified (e.g., target or area of effect), the effect is automatically centered on the caster. Possible triggers might include a fall from a distance greater than the caster's height, the appearance of the first beholder within 30 feet of the caster, or the wizard pointing his finger and pronouncing a specified word.<br />Only one chain contingency can be placed on the spellcaster at any one time. If a second is cast, the first chain contingency is cancelled. It is possible to have both a contingency and a chain contingency operating at the same time, provided that there is no overlap in the conditions specified for triggering the two spells.<br />Spells triggered by the chain contingency have a casting time of 1. If the spell is triggered under conditions that are impossible to fulfill, it fails. If one of the spells in a series cannot be fulfilled, the remaining spells in the series are lost. Normal conditions, including line of sight to the target, must be fulfilled. All spells originate from the caster; thus, it is not possible for a caster to teleport and leave behind a series of fireballs to blast his enemies. In this case, the fireballs would either fail or destroy something at the caster's destination.<br />The material components are (in addition to those of the companion spells) 500 gp worth of quicksilver; a gem of at least 1,000 gp value; an eyelash from an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell-using creature; and an ivory statuette of the wizard (which is not destroyed in the casting of the spell) which must be carried by the spellcaster in order for the chain contingency to perform its function when triggered."

Furthermore, this change is unalterable by any means short of a wish spell; a dispel magic will not reverse the spell.<br />The caster must physically touch the item; if it is an opponent or something an opponent is using or wearing, the wizard must get into melee and make a successful attack roll. Any single metal item can be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor worn by a creature can be changed to crystal, but the creature's shield would not be affected, and vice versa. All items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or protection (the DM has this information). A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two pluses) chance to save; +5 magical armor has a 25% chance to be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by magical weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts and relics constructed of metal may be affected at the discretion of the DM, though it is highly unlikely. Affected items not immediately protected are shattered and permanently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or any weighty weapon, including a staff."

In addition, a source of water is created within the pocket.<br />Before the spell is cast, the area to be moved must be surrounded by solid markers of material from the destination plane. Thus, if a wizard wants to move his castle to the Elemental Plane of Fire, he must first surround the area with solid blocks of matter from the Elemental Plane of Fire, such as hardened magma or magically-crystallized fire. The blocks must be spaced no more than five feet apart and may be placed above ground or under the surface (at a depth of no more than three feet).<br />The wizard must be within the area to be moved when he casts the spell. When the land moves, a hemispherical crater is left behind in the Prime Material plane. Inside its pocket on the desired plane, the land continues its existence as if nothing changed, with the exception of occasional visits from planar creatures.<br />Any land that is moved in this manner can never again be moved with this spell.<br />The material component (in addition to the markers) is the appropriate magical device to control elementals of the desired plane (bowl commanding water elementals, brazier commanding fire elementals, censer controlling air elementals, or stone controlling earth elementals). The item must be permanently placed at the heart of the area of effect and cannot be used for any other purpose.

Thus, if he were the object of the spell, the wizard would be warned in advance if a thief were about to attempt to backstab him, or if a creature were about to leap out from an unexpected direction, or if an attacker were specifically targeting him with a spell or missile weapon. When the warnings are about him personally, the wizard cannot be surprised and always knows the direction from which any attack on him is made. In addition, the spell gives the wizard a general idea of what action he might take to best protect himself--duck, jump right, close his eyes, etc.--and gives him a defensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.<br />When another person is the object of the spell, the wizard receives warnings about that person.

Even artifacts and relics are subject to Mordenkainen's disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster experience level of actually affecting such powerful items. Thus, all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, miscellaneous magical items, artifacts and relics, arms and armor, swords, and miscellaneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcaster can possibly lose all their magical properties when the Mordenkainen's disjunction spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% chance per level of destroying an antimagic shell.

			"body": "This particular spell was the last and most powerful spell developed by the archmentalist Rheizom. It allows the wizard to selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as he sees fit. He can completely reprogram a character, inventing a new persona, a new alignment, and assigning a new class as he sees fit. Only sentient beings can be affected; if the subject is not human, humanoid, or demihuman, he gains a +4 bonus on his saving throw.<br />As described above, programmed amnesia can be used to achieve several different effects. The wizard may choose to make use of any or all of the effects listed below:<br />A. Memory erasure. Any or all memories possessed by the subject can be erased at the caster’s will, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places.<br />B. Memory implant. The caster can create false memories in the subject’s mind as he sees fit. Imaginary friends, events that didn’t really<br />C. Skill erasure. The subject can be made to forget any or all class-based skills or proficiencies, including all or part of his THAC0 (it resets to 20), thief abilities, spellcasting, turning undead, or any other ability that stems from knowledge. About the only characteristics that can’t be affected by this usage of Rheizom’s programmed amnesia are hit points, saving throws, and ability scores. A character’s native language cannot be erased, either.<br />D. Persona erasure. Combining the effects of a skill erasure and a memory erasure, this leaves the subject as a clean slate. Only his ability scores, hit points, saving throws, and native language remain. The character may assume any class or alignment available, beginning as a 1st-level character just as if he had decided to dual-class. (Even demihumans can dual-class in this fashion, since they forget all skills of their previous class.)<br />E. Persona implant. By erasing the existing personality and implanting a false set of memories, the wizard can build a new persona for the mind-wiped character. In effect, he can decide what class, alignment, and personality the subject will assume after his persona erasure. If the new persona is an adventurer, the character dual-classes, as described above.<br />F. Programmed erasure. The subject can be programmed to suffer a memory, skill, or persona erasure when a certain event takes place. For example, the wizard could set the subject to be wiped clean as a slate when the subject receives a coded message or arrives at some destination. Optionally, the wizard can decide to have an erasure partially or totally lifted when the programmed condition comes to pass.<br />The casting time of this spell varies according to what effects the wizard wishes to impose on the subject. To cast just one of the listed effects, the wizard must spend two days secluded away from any distractions—a personal laboratory is a good example of a secluded place. In between the intense eight-hour casting sessions, the wizard can sleep and eat in the area he chose to seclude himself in. If the wizard breaks his seclusion for any reason, the spell is lost. Also, for every effect over the first, another day (with its eight-hour intense casting period) must be spent in seclusion.<br />The wizard must be able to see the spell’s subject. At the end of each day of casting, the subject makes a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect.<br />Programmed amnesia is normally permanent, unless the wizard cares to specify a set of conditions or parameters that will end the effect (see F, above). Its effects can only be undone by a restoration or wish spell, or by successful use of the psionic science psychic surgery. A character who picks up new skills or class abilities while amnesiac must make a saving throw vs. spell when his own real memories return; if he fails, the skills he learned as an amnesiac are gone forever, replaced by his former abilities, but if he succeeds he retains any new skills, and may even choose to continue in his new class as a dual-classed character. Dungeon Masters should keep in mind that an amnesiac character should still meet the new class’s full prerequisites before he can become that class.<br />Obviously, this is a very powerful spell, and the DM should very carefully examine a PC’s use of this magic. Dungeon Masters, take note—there are dozens of excellent plot vehicles hiding here if an NPC wizard uses this on a player character! Also, be aware that destroying a creature’s personality and replacing it with one more amenable to the wizard’s designs is never a good act."

			"body": "With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of any living thing or creature below demigod status (greater or lesser deity, singular dragon type, or the like). The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has all of its abilities save those dependent upon Intelligence, innate magical abilities, and magic resistance, for the mind of the creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus, he can change into a griffon and fly away, then to an efreet and fly through a roaring flame, then to a titan to lift up a wagon, etc. These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.<br />For example, a wizard is in combat and assumes the form of a will o' wisp. When this form is no longer useful, the wizard changes into a stone golem and walks away. When pursued, the golem-shape is changed to that of a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off and become a bush. If detected as the latter, the wizard can become a dragon, an ant, or just about anything he is familiar with.<br />A wizard adopting another form also adopts its vulnerabilities. For example, a wizard who becomes a spectre is powerless in daylight, and is subject to being turned, controlled, or destroyed by opposing clerics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is killed in another form does not revert to his original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.<br />The material component is a jade circlet worth no less than 5,000 gp, which shatters at the end of the spell's duration. In the meantime, the circlet is left in the wake of the shape change, and premature shattering ends the spell immediately."

			"body": "This awful spell brings into existence a short-lived sphere of annihilation (as described in Appendix 3 of the DMG). The sphere is a black ball of nothingness about 2 feet in diameter that instantly and utterly destroys any matter that comes into contact with it. The sphere appears anywhere in the spell’s range and moves up to 15 feet per round as the wizard directs. If the wizard attempts to bring the sphere into contact with a living creature, the potential victim gains a saving throw vs. breath weapon to dodge aside, but a victim who is unaware of the sphere’s appearance or unable to move is destroyed without a saving throw.<br />Once conjured, the sphere of ultimate destruction may not move exactly as the caster wishes. The wizard has a 75% chance to control it, plus 1% per point of Intelligence over 12 and 3% for each point over 15. In other words, a wizard with an Intelligence of 18 would gain a +12% bonus to his chance to control the sphere. If the wizard fails to control the sphere in any given round, it automatically moves directly towards him at its maximum speed of 15 feet per round. Unlike the magical item, another wizard may not contest the caster’s control of a sphere of ultimate destruction unless the second wizard possesses a talisman of the sphere. (See the DMG.)<br />Should a gate spell be cast upon the sphere, there is a 50% chance that the sphere is destroyed, a 35% chance that nothing happens, and a 15% chance that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything in a 180-foot radius to another plane of existence. If the sphere is touched by a rod of cancellation, a tremendous explosion inflicts 3d4 x 10 points of damage to everything within 60 feet as the two forces negate each other. No other spell or magical item has any effect on a sphere of ultimate destruction.<br />There is a 5% chance that any particular manifestation of this spell does not cause a victim’s utter destruction but instead transports him to a random plane of existence. The conjuring wizard has no way of knowing whether he has destroyed his enemy or merely blasted him into some remote dimension. The material component of this spell is a dark crystal ball that has been on the Ethereal Plane and that can be comfortably held in two hands.<br />As noted in the previous chapter, several new spell characteristics appear in the spell descriptions of this book. These include casting subtlety, sensory signature, critical strikes, and knockdown. Refer to page 136 for more information about these new characteristics."

To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item.

The components can be enchanted only once per month (usually on a night of a clear, full moon).

Failure to save vs. spell causes the creature or creatures to face their nemeses, the opponents most feared and inimical to them. Actual combat must then take place, for no magical means of escape is possible. The foe fought is real for all intents and purposes; affected creatures that lose will die.

Items larger than a 10-foot-radius sphere cannot be fashioned. Creating the object requires only one round, regardless of size. Thus, a wizard could make an impenetrable dome or a small boat with this spell.<br />Objects made of wildfire are neither stable nor permanent.

Other forms of wishes, however, cause the spellcaster to weaken (-3 on Strength) and require 2d4 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time, space, and his body. Regardless of what is wished for, the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried out. Casting a wish spell ages the caster five years.<br />Discretionary power of the DM is necessary in order to maintain game balance.
